( I ( ( ( told ( my mother ) ) ( I ( ( could n't ) ( do it ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( ( ( ( ( I ( met ( ( people ( from all ) ) ( walks ( of life ) ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( ( many ( of them ) ) ( doing ( ( the thing ) ( they loved ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( living ( on ( ( the frontiers ) ( of possibility ) ) ) ) ) . )

( There ( ( had ( to ( be ( ( another piece ) ( of ( the jigsaw ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( I ( ( ( realized ( at ( the ( same time ) ) ) ) ( that ( ( ( ( it ( is ( okay ( to ( be ( ( ( ( ( ( an outsider ) , ) ( ( ( a ( recent arrival ) ) , ) ( new ( on ( the scene ) ) ) ) ) -- ) and ) ( not ( just okay ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ( ( ( something ( to ( be ( thankful for ) ) ) ) , ) perhaps ) ( ( a gift ) ( from ( the boat ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( Possibilities ( that ( ( would not ) ( have ( been allowed ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( were outrageously ) encouraged ) . ) )
( There ( ( was ( ( ( ( ( an ( energy there ) ) , ) ( an ( implacable optimism ) ) ) , ) ( ( a ( strange mixture ) ) ( of ( ( humility and ) daring ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( I ( ( followed ( my hunches ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( ( gathered ( around me ) ) ( ( a ( small team ) ) ( of ( people ( ( for whom ) ( ( ( ( the label ) `` ) ( It ( ( ca n't ) ( be ( done '' ) ) ) ) ) ( was ( an ( irresistible challenge ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( For ( a year ) ) ( we ( ( were penniless ) . ) ) )
( ( At ( ( the end ) ( of ( each day ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( made ( ( ( a ( huge pot ) ) ( of soup ) ) ( which ( ( we all ) shared ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( ( worked well ) ( into ( each night ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( Most ( of ( our ideas ) ) ) ( were crazy ) ) , ) but ) ( ( a few ) ( were brilliant ) ) ) , ) and ) ( we ( broke through ) ) ) . )

( ( ( My hunches ) again ) . )
( ( ( Three months ) later ) ( ( ( ( ( I ( had relocated ) ) , ) and ) ( ( the adventure ) ( has continued ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Before ( I ( ( close though ) ( , ( let ( me ( ( tell you ) ( about ( my grandmother ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( Her father ) ( ( ( died soon ) ( after ( she ( was born ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Her mother ) ( ( ( raised her ) alone ) . ) )
( ( At 17 ) ( she ( ( became ( ( the ( second wife ) ) ( of ( a ( Mandarin ( ( whose mother ) ( beat her ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( `` ( ( It ( ( ca n't ) ( be ( done '' ) ) ) ) ( ( was ( shown ( to ( be wrong ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( My mother ) ( ( ( phoned minutes ) later ) . ) )
( ( ( A ( few days ) ) later ) ( , ( we ( ( ( ( went ( to ( ( a ( Buddhist temple ) ) ( in Footscray ) ) ) ) and ) ( sat ( around ( her casket ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( ( ( told ( her stories ) ) and ) ( ( assured her ) ( that ( we ( ( were still ) ( with her ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( At midnight ) ( ( the monk ) ( ( ( came and ) ( ( told us ) ( he ( had ( to ( close ( the casket ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( My mother ) ( ( ( asked us ) ( to ( feel ( her hand ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( She ( asked ( the monk ) ) ) ( , ( `` ( Why ( ( ( ( ( is it ) ( that ( ( her hand ) ( is ( ( ( so warm ) and ) ( ( the rest ) ( of her ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( is ( so cold ) ) ) ? ) '' ) ) ) ) )

( ( Given ( ( ( who ( we were ) ) and ) ( how ( life ( had ( shaped us ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( can now ) ( see ( that ( ( ( the men ) ( who ( might ( have ( come ( into ( our lives ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( would ( have ( thwarted us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )

( I ( ( ( ( ( ( spend ( most ( of ( ( my time ) ( in jails ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( in prisons ) ) , ) ( on ( death row ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( ( one ( of ( ( the things ) ( that ( 's ( ( emerged ( in ( my ( short time ) ) ) ) here ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( TED ( has ( an identity ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( And ( ( ( sometimes when ) ( it ( comes ( through TED ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( has ( ( ( meaning and ) power ) ( that ( it ( ( does n't ) ( have ( when ( it ( does n't ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( mention ( that ( because ( I ( think ( identity ( is ( really important ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( When ( I ( would ( ( see her ) ( as ( ( ( ( a ( little boy ) ) , ) And ) ( she ( 'd ( ( squeeze me ) ( so tight ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( I ( ( ( could barely ) ( ( breathe and ) ( then ( she ( 'd ( let ( me go ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( ( ( ( We ( ( have ( a ( hard time ) ) ) ( talking ( about race ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( I ( believe ( it ( 's ( because ( we ( are ( unwilling ( to ( commit ( ourselves ( to ( ( a process ) ( of ( ( truth and ) reconciliation ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( I ( was ( giving some ) ) ) ( ( ( lectures ( in Germany ) ) ( about ( the ( death penalty ) ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( yet ( , ( there ( ( is ( this disconnect ) ) . ) ) ) ) )

( And ( ( for me ) ( , ( it ( ( becomes ( necessary ( to ( integrate ( the two ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( Because ( ultimately ( we ( are ( talking ( about ( a ( need ( to ( be ( more hopeful ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( more committed ) ( , ( more ( ( dedicated ( to ( ( the ( basic challenges ) ) ( of living ) ) ) ) ( in ( a ( complex world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( But ( ( ( thinking ( about them ) ) ( in ( ( a way ) ( that ( is ( integrated ( in ( our ( own lives ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( You ( know ultimately ) ) , ) ( ( we all ) ( have ( to ( believe ( things ( we ( ( have n't ) seen ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( And ( it ( ( 's ( that ( ( ( ( ( ( ( mind-heart connection ) ( that ( I ( believe ( ( compels us ) ( to ( not ( just ( be ( attentive ( to ( all ( the ( bright ( and ( dazzly things ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( but also ) ) ( the dark ) ) and ) ( difficult things ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( Well ( that ( ( orientation ( of ( the spirit ) ) ) ( ( is ( very much ) ) ( at ( ( the core ) ( of ( what ( I ( believe ( ( even ( TED communities ) ) ( have ( to ( be ( engaged in ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( You ( ( should ( ask ( for ( some ( of that ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( because ( I ( was ( up ( too late ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( was n't ) ( thinking ( real ( straight ( , ( I ( started ( working ( on ( a motion ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( had ( ( ( ( a client ) ( who ( was ( ( 14 years ) old ) ) ) ) , ) ( a ( young ( , ( poor ( black kid ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( ( put ( in ( my motion ) ) ) ( that ( there ( was ( ( ( ( ( prosecutorial misconduct ) and ) ( police misconduct ) ) and ) ( judicial misconduct ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( There ( ( ( was ( a ( crazy line ) ) ) ( in there ) ) ( about ( how ( there ( ( 's ( no conduct ) ) ( in ( this county ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( it ( 's ( all misconduct ) ) ) ) . )

( And ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( to ( my horror ) ) , ) ( not only ) ) ( ( had I ) ( written it ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( had ( ( sent it ) ( to court ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( A ( couple months ) ) ( ( ( ( ( went by ) , ) and ) ( I ( ( had just ) ( forgotten ( all ( about it ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( I ( finally ( ( ( ( decided , ) oh ) ( gosh ( , ( I ( 've ( got ( to ( ( ( go ( to ( the court ) ) ) and ) ( do ( this ( crazy case ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( ( ( ( ( got ( into ( my car ) ) ) and ) ( I ( was ( feeling ( really overwhelmed ) ) ) ) ) -- ) overwhelmed ) . ) ) )

( And ( I ( finally ( ( ( ( got ( out ( of ( the car ) ) ) ) and ) ( I ( started ( walking ( up ( to ( the courthouse ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( as ( I ( was ( ( walking up ) ( ( the steps ) ( of ( this courthouse ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( there ( ( ( was ( an ( older ( black man ) ) ) ) ( who ( ( was ( the janitor ) ) ( in ( this courthouse ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( When ( ( this man ) ( saw me ) ) ) ( , ( he ( ( ( ( came over ) ( to me ) ) and ) ( ( ( ( he said ) , ) `` ) ( ( Who ( ( are you ) ? ) ) '' ) ) ) ) ) )
( I ( ( ( ( ( said , ) `` ) ( Yes ( , sir ) ) ) . ) '' ) )

( And ( he ( ( whispered ( in ( my ear ) ) ) . ) ) )
( He ( ( ( ( ( said , ) `` ) ( I ( 'm ( so ( proud ( of you ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) )
( And ( I ( ( have ( to ( ( ( tell you ) , ) ( it ( was energizing ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( ( connected deeply ) ( with ( ( ( ( something ( in me ) ) ( about identity ) ) , ) ( about ( ( ( the capacity ) ( of ( every person ) ) ) ( to ( contribute ( Well ( I ( went ( into ( the courtroom ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( as ( soon ( as ( I ( walked inside ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the judge ) ( ( ( saw me ) ( coming in ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( people ( ( ( started ( coming in ) ) ( because ( they ( were ( just outraged ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( had ( written ( these ( crazy things ) ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( ( before ( I ( knew it ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the courtroom ) ( was ( filled ( with ( people ( angry ( that ( we ( were ( talking ( about race ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) that ) ( we ( were ( talking ( about poverty ) ) ) ) ) , ) that ) ( we ( were ( talking ( about inequality ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )

( And ( he ( ( ( ( ( kept ( looking ( through ( the window ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( he ( could ( hear ( ( all ( of this ) ) holler ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( He ( ( ( kept pacing ) ( ( back and ) forth ) ) . ) )
( And ( finally ( , ( ( ( this ( older ( black man ) ) ) ( with ( ( this ( ( very worried ) look ) ) ( on ( his face ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( came ( into ( the courtroom ) ) ) and ) ( ( sat down ) ( behind me ) ) ) , ) ( almost ( at ( counsel table ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( About 10 ) minutes ) later ) ( the judge ) ) ( ( said ( we ( would ( take ( a break ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( during ( the ( break there ) ) ) ( ( was ( ( a ( deputy sheriff ) ) ( who ( was ( offended ( that ( ( the janitor ) ( had ( come ( into court ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( this deputy ) ( ( ( ( jumped up ) and ) ( he ( ( ran over ) ( to ( this ( older ( black man ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( He ( ( ( said , ) `` ) ( ( ( ( Jimmy , ) ( what ( ( are you ) ( doing ( in ( this courtroom ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) '' ) ) )
( And ( ( this ( older ( black man ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( stood up ) and ) ( ( ( ( ( he ( looked ( at ( that deputy ) ) ) ) and ) ( he ( looked ( at me ) ) ) ) and ) ( he ( ( ( said , ) `` ) ( I ( ( came ( into ( this courtroom ) ) ) ( to ( ( ( ( ( tell ( this ( young man ) ) ) , ) ( ( keep ( your eyes ) ) ( on ( the prize ) ) ) ) , ) ( hold on ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( I ( 've ( ( come ( to TED ) ) ( because ( I ( believe ( that ( ( many ( of you ) ) ( understand ( that ( ( ( the ( moral arc ) ) ( of ( the universe ) ) ) ( is long ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( it ( bends ( toward justice ) ) ) ) . )
( ( That ( we ( ( can not ) ( be full ) ) ) ) ( ( ( evolved ( human beings ) ) ( until ( we ( care ( about ( ( ( human rights ) and ) ( basic dignity ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( That all ) ( of ( our survival ) ) ) ( ( is ( tied ( to ( ( the survival ) ( of everyone ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( That ( our visions ) ) ( ( of ( ( ( ( technology and ) design ) and ) entertainment ) ) ( and ( creativity ( ( have ( to ( be ( married ( with ( visions ( of ( ( ( ( humanity , ) compassion ) and ) justice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( ( more ( than anything ) ) ( , ( ( for ( those ( of ( you ( who ( share ( that ( , ( I ( ( 've simply ) ( come ( to ( ( ( ( tell you ) ( to ( ( keep ( your eyes ) ) ( on ( the prize ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( hold on ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Thank you ) ( very much ) ) . )
( ( ( So ( you ( ( heard and ) ( saw ( ( an ( obvious desire ) ) ( by ( this audience ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( this community ) ( , ( to ( ( ( ( help you ) ( on ( your way ) ) ) and ) ( to ( ( do something ) ( on ( this issue ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Other ( than ( writing ( a check ) ) ) ) ( , ( what ( ( ( could we ) do ) ? ) ) ) )
( Well ( there ( ( are ( opportunities ( all ( around us ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( If ( you ( live ( in ( ( the state ) ( of California ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( for example ) ( , ( there ( 's ( ( a referendum ) ( ( ( coming up ) ( this spring ) ) ( where ( actually ( there ( 's ( going ( to ( be ( an ( effort ( to ( redirect ( some ( of ( the money ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( we ( spend ( on ( ( the politics ) ( of punishment ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( For example ) ( , ( here ( ( in California ) ( we ( 're ( going ( to ( ( ( ( ( spend ( ( one billion ) dollars ) ) ( on ( the ( death penalty ) ) ) ) ( in ( the ( next ( five years ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( ( one billion ) dollars ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( yet ( , ( ( ( 46 percent ) ( of ( all ( homicide cases ) ) ) ) ( ( ( do n't ) ( result ( in arrest ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( 56 percent ) ( of ( all ( rape cases ) ) ) ) ( ( ( do n't ) result ) . ) )
( So ( there ( ( 's ( an ( opportunity ( to ( change that ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( this referendum ) ( ( would ( ( propose ( having ( those dollars ) ) ) ( go ( to ( ( ( law enforcement ) and ) safety ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( think ( that ( ( opportunity exists ) ( all ( around us ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( There ( ( 's ( been ( ( ( ( this ( huge decline ) ) ( in crime ) ) ( in America ) ) ( over ( the ( last ( three decades ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( part ( of ( ( the narrative ) ( of that ) ) ) ) ( ( ( is sometimes ) ( that ( it ( 's ( ( about increased ) ( incarceration rates ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( What ( ( ( would you ) ( say ( to ( someone ( who ( believed that ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( Well ( actually ( ( the ( violent ( crime rate ) ) ) ( ( has ( remained ( relatively stable ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( The ( great increase ) ) ( in ( ( mass incarceration ) ( in ( this country ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( was n't ) ( really ( in ( violent ( crime categories ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( was ( this ( misguided war ) ) ) ( on drugs ) ) . ) )
( That ( ( 's ( where ( ( the ( dramatic increases ) ) ( have ( come ( in ( our ( prison population ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( we ( ( got ( ( carried away ) ( with ( ( the rhetoric ) ( of punishment ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( so ( we ( ( ( ( have ( ( three ( strikes laws ) ) ( that ( ( ( put people ) ( in prison ) ) ( forever ( for ( stealing ( a bicycle ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( for ( ( ( ( low-level ( property crimes ) ) , ) ( rather than ) ) ( making ( them ( ( give ( those resources ) ) ( back ( to ( ( the people ) ( who ( they victimized ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( I ( ( believe ( we ( need ( to ( ( do more ) ( to ( help ( ( ( ( people ( who ( are ( victimized ( by crime ) ) ) ) ) , ) not ) ( do less ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( I ( ( think ( ( our ( current ( punishment philosophy ) ) ) ( ( does nothing ) ( for ( no one ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( think ( that ( 's ( ( the orientation ) ( that ( we ( have ( to change ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Bryan ( , ( you ( 've ( ( struck ( a ( massive chord ) ) ) here ) ) ) ) ) . )
( You ( ( 're ( an ( inspiring person ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( Do you ) ( know ( ( ( how many ) choices ) ( you ( make ( in ( a ( typical day ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( ( Do you ) ( know ( ( ( how many ) choices ) ( you ( make ( in ( typical week ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( I ( recently ( ( ( ( ( did ( ( a survey ) ( with ( ( over 2,000 ) Americans ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( ( the ( average number ) ) ( of choices ) ) ( that ( ( the ( typical ( American reports ) ) ) making ) ) ) ( is ( ( about 70 ) ( in ( a ( typical day ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( There ( ( ( ( was also ) recently ) ( ( a study ) ( done ( with ( CEOs ( ( in which ) ( they ( followed ( CEOs ( around ( for ( a ( whole week ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( these scientists ) ( simply ( ( documented ( ( ( ( all ( the ( various tasks ) ) ) ( that ( ( these CEOs ) ( engaged in ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( how much ) time ) ( they ( spent ( engaging ( in ( making ( decisions ( related ( to ( these tasks ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( they ( ( found ( that ( ( the ( average CEO ) ) ( engaged ( in ( ( ( about 139 ) tasks ) ( in ( a week ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Each task ) ( ( was ( ( ( made up ) ( of ( ( ( many , ) many ) , ) ) ) ( ( many sub-choices ) ( of course ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( 50 percent ) ( of ( their decisions ) ) ) ( ( were ( made ( in ( ( ( nine minutes ) or ) less ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Only ( ( ( ( about 12 ) percent ) ( of ( the decisions ) ) ) ( ( did they ) ( make ( ( an ( hour ( or more ) ) ) ( of ( their time ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Think ( about ( your ( own choices ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( Do you ) ( know ( ( ( how many ) choices ) ( ( make it ) ( into ( ( ( your ( nine ( minute category ) ) ) versus ) ( your ( one ( hour category ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( How well ) ( ( ( do you ) ( think ( you ( 're ( doing ( at ( managing ( those choices ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( Today ( I ( ( want ( to ( talk ( about ( ( ( one ( of ( ( the ( biggest ( modern day ) ) ) ( choosing ( problems ( that ( we have ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( which ( is ( the ( choice ( overload problem ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( want ( to ( talk ( about ( ( ( the problem ) and ) ( some ( potential solutions ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Now ( as ( I ( talk ( about ( this problem ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( I ( 'm ( going ( to ( ( have ( some questions ) ) ( for you ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( I ( 'm ( going ( to ( want ( to ( know ( your answers ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( ( when ( I ( ( ( ask you ) ( ( ( ( a question ) , ) ( since ( I ( 'm blind ) ) ) ) , ) ) ( only ( ( raise ( your hand ) ) ( if ( you ( want ( to ( ( burn off ) ( some calories ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Otherwise ( , ( ( when ( I ( ( ask you ) ( ( ( ( a question ) , ) and ) ( ( if ( ( your answer ) ( is yes ) ) ) ( , ( I ( 'd ( like ( you ( to ( clap ( your hands ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( ( ( ( So ( ( when ( I ( was ( ( a ( graduate student ) ) ( at ( Stanford University ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( used ( to ( go ( to ( this ( very ( , ( very ( upscale ( grocery store ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( ( at least ) ( at ( ( that time ) ( it ( was ( truly upscale ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( was ( ( a store ) ( called ( Draeger 's ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( ( this store ) ( , ( it ( ( was ( almost ( like ( going ( to ( an ( amusement park ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( They ( ( had ( ( ( 250 ( different kinds ) ) ( of ( ( ( ( mustards and ) vinegars ) and ) ( over ( ( 500 ( different kinds ) ) ( of ( ( ( ( fruits and ) vegetables ) and ) ( ( ( more ( than two ) ) ( dozen ( different kinds ) ) ) ( of ( bottled water ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( -- ( and ( this ( was ( during ( ( a time ) ( when ( we ( actually ( used ( to ( drink ( tap water ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( I ( used ( to ( love ( going ( to ( this store ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ( on ( one occasion ) ) ( I ( ( ( asked myself ) , ) ( well ( how ( come ( you ( never ( buy anything ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( ( Here 's ) ( their ( olive ( oil aisle ) ) ) ) . )
( They ( ( had ( over ( ( 75 ( different kinds ) ) ( of ( ( ( olive oil ) , ) ( including ( those ( that ( were ( in ( ( a ( locked case ) ) ( that ( came ( from ( thousand-year-old ( olive trees ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( I ( ( ( ( ( one day ) ( decided ( to ( pay ( ( a visit ) ( to ( the manager ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( I ( asked ( ( ( ( the manager ) , ) `` ) ( ( Is ( this model ) ) ( of ( ( ( offering people ) ( ( all ( this choice ) ) ( really ( working ? ) ) ) ) '' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( And ( he ( ( pointed ( to ( ( ( the busloads ) ( of tourists ) ) ( that ( would ( ( show up ) ( ( everyday , ) ( with ( cameras ( ready usually ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( We ( decided ( to ( do ( a ( little experiment ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( we ( ( picked jam ) ( for ( our experiment ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( Here 's ) ( their ( jam aisle ) ) ) . )
( They ( ( had ( ( 348 ( different kinds ) ) ( of jam ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( set up ) ( ( a ( little ( tasting booth ) ) ) ( right ( near ( ( the entrance ) ( of ( the store ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( More people ) ( stopped ( when ( there ( were 24 ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( ( about 60 ) percent ) , ) ( than ( when ( there ( were ( six ( , ( about ( 40 percent ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( The ( next thing ) ) ( we ( looked at ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( in ( which case ) ) ( were ( people ( more ( likely ( to ( buy ( ( a jar ) ( of jam ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( we ( ( see ( the ( opposite effect ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Of ( ( the people ) ( who ( stopped ( when ( there ( were 24 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( only three ) percent ) ( of them ) ) ( actually ( ( bought ( ( a jar ) ( of jam ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( Of ( ( the people ) ( who ( stopped ( when ( there ( were six ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( well now ) ( we ( saw ( that ( ( ( 30 percent ) ( of them ) ) ( actually ( bought ( ( a jar ) ( of jam ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( ( if ( you ( do ( the math ) ) ) ) ( , ( people ( ( were ( ( ( ( at least ) six ) times ) ( more ( likely ( to ( ( buy ( ( a jar ) ( of jam ) ) ) ( if ( they ( encountered ( six ( than ( if ( they ( encountered 24 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( Now ( ( choosing ( not ( to ( buy ( ( a jar ) ( of jam ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( is probably ) good ) ( for us ) ) ( -- ( ( ( at least ) ( it ( 's ( good ( for ( our waistlines ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ) ) ) ) but ) ( it ( ( turns out ) ( that ( ( this ( choice ( overload problem ) ) ) ( ( affects us ) ( even ( in ( ( very consequential ) decisions ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( ( ( ( choose not ) ( to choose ) ) , ) ( ( even when ) ( it ( goes ( against ( our ( best self-interests ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( I ( 'm ( going ( to ( ( describe ( to you ) ) ( ( a study ) ( I ( did ( with ( ( ( ( ( Gur Huberman ) , ) ( Emir Kamenica ) ) , ) ( ( Wei Jang ) ( where ( we ( ( looked ( at ( ( the ( retirement ( savings decisions ) ) ) ( of ( nearly ( a ( million Americans ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( from ( ( ( ( about 650 ) plans ) all ) ( in ( the U.S. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( And ( ( what ( we ( looked at ) ) ) ( ( was ( whether ( ( ( ( ( ( the number ) ( of ( ( fund offerings ) ( available ( in ( a ( retirement ( savings plan ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( the ( 401 plan ) ) ) , ) ( does ( that ( ( affect ( ( people 's ) likelihood ) ) ( to ( ( save more ) ( for tomorrow ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( what ( we found ) ) ( ( was ( that ( indeed ( there ( was ( a correlation ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( in ( these plans ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( had ( ( ( about 657 ) plans ) ( that ( ranged ( from ( ( offering people ) ( ( anywhere ( ( ( from two ) to ) 59 ) ) ( different ( fund offerings ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( what ( we found ) ) ( ( was ( ( that , ) ( ( ( the ( more funds ) ) offered ) ( , ( indeed ( , ( there ( was ( less ( participation rate ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( ( ( if ( you ( look ( at ( the extremes ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( those plans ) ( that ( ( offered you ) ( ( ( ( two funds ) , ) ( participation rates ) ) ( ( were around ) ( in ( ( the mid-70s ) ( -- ( still ( ( not ( as high ) ) ( as ( we ( want ( it ( to be ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( In ( ( those plans ) ( that ( offered ( ( nearly 60 ) funds ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( participation rates ) ( ( ( have now ) ( dropped ( to ( about ( the ( 60th percentile ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Now ( it ( ( ( turns out ) ( that ( ( even ( if ( you ( do ( ( choose ( to participate ) ) ( when ( there ( ( ( are ( ( more choices ) present ) ) , ) ( even then ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( has ( negative consequences ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( ( for ( ( ( ( ( ( those people ) ( who ( did ( choose ( to participate ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( the ( more choices ) ) available ) ) , ) ( ( the ( ( more likely ) people ) ) ( were ( to ( completely ( avoid ( ( stocks or ) ( equity funds ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( The ( more choices ) ) available ) , ) ( ( the ( more likely ) ) ( they ( were ( to ( ( put ( all ( their money ) ) ) ( in ( pure ( money ( market accounts ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Now ( ( neither ( of ( these ( extreme decisions ) ) ) ) ( ( are ( ( ( the kinds ) ( of decisions ) ) ( that ( ( any ( of us ) ) ( would ( ( recommend ( for people ) ) ( when ( you ( 're ( considering ( their ( future ( financial well-being ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Well ( , ( ( over ( the ( past decade ) ) ) ( , ( we ( have ( observed ( ( three ( main ( negative consequences ) ) ) ( to ( ( offering people ) ( ( ( more and ) more ) choices ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( They ( 're ( more ( likely ( to ( delay choosing ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( ( procrastinate even ) ( when ( it ( goes ( against ( their ( best self-interest ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( They ( ( 're ( more ( likely ( to ( make ( ( worse choices ) ( -- ( ( ( worse ( financial choices ) ) , ) ( medical choices ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( 're ( more ( likely ( to ( ( ( choose ( things ( that ( make ( them ( less satisfied ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( even when ) ( they ( ( do objectively ) better ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( The ( main reason ) ) ( for this ) ) ( is because ) ) , ) ( we ( might ( enjoy ( gazing ( at ( ( those ( giant walls ) ) ( of ( ( ( ( ( ( ( mayonnaises , ) mustards ) , ) vinegars ) , ) jams ) , ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) but ) ( we ( ( ca n't ) ( ( ( actually ( do ( ( the math ) ( of ( ( comparing and ) contrasting ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( actually ( picking ( from ( that ( stunning display ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( ( what ( I ( want ( to ( ( propose ( to you ) ) today ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( are ( ( ( ( four ( simple techniques ) ) -- ) ( techniques ( that ( we ( have ( ( tested ( in ( ( ( one way ) or ) another ) ) ) ( in ( different ( research venues ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ) ( that ( you ( ( can easily ) ( apply ( in ( your businesses ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( You ( 've ( heard ( it ( said before ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ( ( it ( ( 's never ) ( been ( ( more true ) ( than today ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( that ( less ( is more ) ) ) ) ) . )
( People ( ( ( ( are always ) ( upset ( when ( I ( ( ( say , ) `` ) Cut ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) )
( They ( ( ( 're always ) ( worried ( they ( 're ( going ( to ( lose ( shelf space ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( But ( ( in fact ) ( , ( ( what ( we ( 're ( seeing ( ( more and ) more ) ) ) ) ) ( is ( that ( ( if ( you ( are ( willing ( to ( ( ( ( ( cut , ) ( get ( rid ( of ( those ( extraneous ( redundant options ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) well ) ( there ( 's ( ( an increase ) ( in sales ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( there ( 's ( ( a lowering ) ( of costs ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( there ( ( is ( ( an improvement ) ( of ( the ( choosing experience ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( When ( ( ( Proctor & ) Gamble ) ( went ( from ( ( ( 26 ( different kinds ) ) ( of ( ( Head & ) Shoulders ) ) ) ( to 15 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( saw ( ( ( an increase ) ( in sales ) ) ( by ( 10 percent ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( When ( ( the ( Golden ( Cat Corporation ) ) ) ( got ( rid ( of ( their ( 10 ( worst-selling ( cat ( litter products ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( saw ( ( ( ( ( an increase ) ( in profits ) ) ( by ( 87 percent ) ) ) -- ) ( ( a function ) ( of ( ( both increase ) ( in ( ( sales and ) ( lowering ( of costs ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( You know ) ( , ( ( the ( average ( grocery store ) ) ) ( today ( ( ( offers you ) ( 45,000 products ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( The ( typical Walmart ) ) ( today ( ( ( offers you ) ( 100,000 products ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the ( ninth ( largest retailer ) ) ) , ) ( ( the ( ninth ( biggest retailer ) ) ) ( in ( the world ) ) ) ) today ) ( is Aldi ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( offers you ) ( ( ( ( only 1,400 ) products ) -- ) ( ( one kind ) ( of ( canned ( tomato sauce ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Now ( in ( the ( financial ( savings world ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( think ( ( one ( of ( the ( best examples ) ) ) ) ( that ( ( has recently ) ( ( come out ) ( on ( how ( ( to best ) ( manage ( ( the ( choice offerings ) ) ( ( has actually ) ( been ( something ( that ( ( David Laibson ) ( ( was heavily ) ( involved ( in ( ( designing , ) ( which ( was ( ( the program ) ( that ( they ( have ( at Harvard ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )

( ( For ( ( those people ) ( who ( actually ( want ( to choose ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( 're ( given ( ( ( 20 funds ) , ) ( not ( ( ( 300 or ) more ) funds ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Now ( before ( we ( ( started ( our session ) ) ( this afternoon ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( had ( ( a chat ) ( with Gary ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( Gary ( ( said ( that ( he ( would ( ( be ( willing ( to ( ( offer people ) ( in ( this audience ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( an ( all-expenses-paid ( free vacation ) ) ) ( to ( ( the ( ( most beautiful ) road ) ) ( in ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Here ( ( 's ( ( a description ) ( of ( the road ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( I ( ( 'd ( like ( you ( to ( read it ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( now ( I ( ( ( ( ( 'll ( ( give you ) ( ( a ( few seconds ) ) ( to ( read it ) ) ) ) ) and ) then ) ( I ( want ( you ( to ( ( clap ( your hands ) ) ( if ( you ( 're ( ready ( to ( ( ( take Gary ) up ) ( on ( his offer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Is that ) all ) ? )
( ( All right ) ( , ( ( let ( me ( ( show you ) ( ( some more ) ( about this ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( You guys ) ( ( ( ( knew ( there ( was ( a trick ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( did n't ) you ) ) . ) )
( ( Now ( who ( 's ( ready ( to ( go ( on ( this trip ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( I ( ( think ( I ( might ( ( have actually ) ( heard ( more hands ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( All right ) . )
( Now ( ( ( ( ( ( in fact ) ( , ( you ( ( had ( ( objectively more ) information ) ) ( ( the ( first time ) ) ( around ( than ( ( the ( second time ) ) around ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( would ( venture ( to ( guess ( that ( you ( felt ( that ( it ( ( was ( more real ) ) ( the ( second ( time around ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Because ( ( the pictures ) ( made ( it ( feel ( more ( real ( to you ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Which ( ( ( brings me ) ( to ( the ( second technique ) ) ) ) ( ( for ( handling ( the ( choice ( overload problem ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( which ( is concretization ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( That ( in order ) ) ( for ( people ( to ( understand ( ( the differences ) ( between ( the choices ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( they ( have ( to ( be ( able ( to ( understand ( ( the consequences ) ( associated ( with ( each choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( that ( ( the consequences ) ( need ( to ( be ( felt ( in ( ( a ( vivid sort ) ) ( of way ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( in ( a ( ( very concrete ) way ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Why ( ( ( do people ) ( ( spend ( ( an average ) ( of ( ( ( 15 to ) 30 ) percent ) ) ) ) ( more ( when ( they ( ( use ( ( ( an ( ATM card ) ) or ) ( a ( credit card ) ) ) ) ( as ( opposed ( to cash ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( Because ( it ( ( does n't ) ( feel ( like ( real money ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( it ( ( ( turns out ) ( that ( ( making ( it ( feel ( more concrete ) ) ) ) ( ( can actually ) ( be ( ( a ( ( very positive ) tool ) ) ( to ( use ( in ( getting ( people ( to ( save more ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( ( a study ) ( that ( I ( did ( with ( ( ( Shlomo Benartzi ) and ) ( Alessandro Previtero ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( ( did ( ( ( a study ) ( with ( people ( at ING ) ) ) ) ( -- ( ( employees ( that ( ( are all ) ( working ( at ING ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ) ) ) and ) ( now ( ( these people ) ( ( were all ) ( in ( ( a session ) ( where ( they ( 're ( ( doing enrollment ) ( for ( their ( 401 plan ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( ( ( ( ( during ( that session ) ) ( , ( we ( ( kept ( the session ) ) ( ( exactly ( the way ) ) ( it ( used ( to be ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( we ( added ( one ( little thing ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( The ( one ( little thing ) ) ) ( we added ) ) ( ( ( was we ) ( ( asked people ) ( to ( just ( ( think ( about ( ( all ( the ( positive things ) ) ) ( that ( would ( happen ( in ( your life ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( if ( you ( saved more ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( By ( doing ( that ( simple thing ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( there ( was ( ( ( an increase ) ( in enrollment ) ) ( by ( 20 percent ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( there ( ( was ( ( an increase ) ( in ( ( ( ( the amount ) ( of ( people ( willing ( to save ) ) ) ) ) or ) ( ( the amount ) ( that ( they ( were ( willing ( to ( ( put down ) ( into ( their savings ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( account ( by ( four percent ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( We ( ( can ( handle ( ( more categories ) ( than ( we ( can ( handle choices ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( for example ) ( , ( here ( ( 's ( ( a study ) ( we ( did ( in ( a ( magazine aisle ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( It ( ( ( turns out ) ( that ( ( in ( Wegmans ( grocery stores ) ) ) ( ( ( up and ) down ) ( ( ( ( the ( northeast corridor ) ) , ) ( the ( magazine aisles ) ) ) ( ( range ( anywhere ( from ( ( 331 ( different kinds ) ) ( of magazines ) ) ) ) ) ( ( all ( the way ) ) ( up ( to 664 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( you ( know what ) ) ? ) )
( ( If ( ( ( I ( show ( you ( 600 magazines ) ) ) ) and ) ( I ( ( ( divide them ) up ) ( into ( ( ( ( 10 categories ) , ) versus ) ( ( ( I ( show ( you ( 400 magazines ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( divide them ) up ) ( into ( 20 categories ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( believe ( that ( I ( have ( ( ( given you ) ( ( ( more choice ) and ) ( a ( better ( choosing experience ) ) ) ) ) ( if ( I ( ( gave you ) ( ( the 400 ) ( than ( if ( I ( ( gave you ) ( the 600 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Because ( ( the categories ) ( ( tell me ) ( how ( to ( ( tell them ) apart ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Here ( ( are ( two ( different ( jewelry displays ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( One ( is ( called ( `` ( Jazz '' ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( the ( other one ) ) ( is ( called ( `` Swing ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' )
( ( If ( you ( think ( ( ( the display ) ( on ( the left ) ) ) ( is ( ( Swing and ) ( ( the display ) ( on ( the right ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( Jazz ( , ( clap ( your hands ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Okay ( , ( there ( ( 's some ) . ) ) ) )
( ( If ( you ( think ( ( ( the one ) ( on ( the left ) ) ) ( is ( ( Jazz and ) ( ( the one ) ( on ( the right ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( Swing ( , ( clap ( your hands ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Okay ( , ( ( ( a bit ) more ) . ) ) )
( Now ( it ( ( ( turns out ) ( you ( 're right ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( The one ) ( on ( the left ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( ( ( ( Jazz and ) ( ( the one ) ( on ( the right ) ) ) ) ( is Swing ) ) , ) but ) ( you ( know what ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( This ( ( is ( a ( ( highly useless ) ( categorization scheme ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( The categories ) ( ( need ( to ( say ( ( ( ( something ( to ( the chooser ) ) ) , ) not ) ( the choice-maker ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( you ( often ( ( ( see ( that problem ) ) ( when ( it ( ( ( comes down ) ( to ( those ( long lists ) ) ) ) ( of ( all ( these funds ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Who ( ( ( ( are they ) actually ) ( supposed ( to ( be informing ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( ( ( It ( ( ( turns out ) ( we ( ( can actually ) ( handle ( ( ( a lot ) more ) information ) ) ) ) ) ( than ( we ( think ( we can ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( we ( ( 've just ) ( got ( to ( ( take it ) ( ( a little ) easier ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( have ( ( to gradually ) ( increase ( the complexity ) ) ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( 'm ( going ( to ( ( show you ) ( ( one example ) ( of ( what ( I ( 'm ( talking about ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Here ( ( ( 's ( a ( German ( car manufacturer ) ) ) ) ( that ( ( gives you ) ( the ( opportunity ( ( to ( completely custom ) ) ( make ( your car ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( You ( ( ( ( 've ( got ( to ( make ( 60 ( different decisions ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( completely ( ( make up ) ( your car ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( ( these decisions ) ( ( vary ( in ( ( the number ) ( of ( choices ( that ( they ( offer ( per decision ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( Car colors ) , ) ( exterior ( car colors ) ) ) -- ) ( I ( 've ( got ( 56 choices ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( Engines , ) gearshift ) -- ) ( four choices ) ) . )
( ( So now ) ( ( what ( I ( 'm ( going ( to do ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( I ( 'm ( going ( to ( vary ( ( the order ) ( ( in which ) ( ( these decisions ) appear ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( So half ) ( of ( the customers ) ) ) ( are ( going ( to ( go ( from ( high choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( 56 ( car colors ) ) ) ) ( ( , ( ( to ( low choice ) ) ( , ( four gearshifts ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( The ( other half ) ) ( of ( the customers ) ) ) ( are ( going ( to ( go ( from ( low choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( four gearshifts ) ( , ( ( to ( 56 ( car colors ) ) ) ( , ( high choice ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( What ( ( ( am I ) ( going ( to ( look at ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( How ( engaged ( you are ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( If ( you ( keep ( hitting ( ( the ( default button ) ) ( per decision ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( that ( means ( you ( 're ( getting overwhelmed ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( that ( means ( I ( 'm ( losing you ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( What ( you find ) ) ( is ( ( the people ) ( who ( ( go ( from ( high choice ) ) ) ( to ( low choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( 're ( hitting ( that ( ( default button ) ( ( ( ( over and ) over ) and ) ( over again ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( 're ( losing them ) ) . ) )
( ( They ( ( go ( from ( low choice ) ) ) ( to ( high choice ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( 're ( hanging ( in there ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( The ( only thing ) ) ( that ( I ( have done ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( I ( have ( varied ( ( the order ) ( ( in which ) ( that ( information ( is presented ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( I ( ( start you ) ( off easy ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( learn ( how ( to choose ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( Even ( though ( choosing gearshift ) ) ) ( ( does n't ) ( ( tell me ) ( anything ( about ( ( my preferences ) ( for ( interior decor ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( it ( still ( ( prepares me ) ( for ( how ( to choose ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( also ( ( gets ( me ( excited ( about ( ( this ( big product ) ) ( that ( I ( 'm ( ( ( putting together ) , ) ( so ( I ( 'm ( more ( willing ( to ( be ( motivated ( to ( be engaged ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( ( let ( me recap ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( have ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( talked ( about ( four techniques ) ) ) ( for ( mitigating ( ( the problem ) ( of ( choice overload ) ) ) ) ) ) ( -- ( cut -- ) ) ) ( get ( rid ( of ( the ( extraneous alternatives ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( ( concretize -- ) ( make ( it real ) ) ) ) ; ) ( categorize ( -- ( ( ( we ( can ( handle ( ( ( more categories ) , ) ( less choices ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( condition ( for complexity ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( All ( of ( these techniques ) ) ) ( that ( I ( 'm ( ( describing ( to you ) ) today ) ) ) ) ) ( ( are ( designed ( to ( help ( you ( manage ( ( your choices ) ( -- ( better ( ( for you ) ( , ( you ( can ( ( use them ) ( ( on yourself ) ( , ( better ( for ( ( the people ) ( that ( you ( are serving ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Because ( ( I ( believe ( that ( ( the key ) ( to ( getting ( ( the most ) ( from choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( is ( to ( be ( choosy ( about choosing ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( the more ) ( ( ( we ( 're ( able ( to ( be ( choosy ( about ( choosing ( the better ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( we ( will ( be ( able ( to ( practice ( ( the art ) ( of choosing ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Thank you ) ( very much ) ) . )
( Threats ( , ( ( in ( ( the wake ) ( of ( ( Bin ( Laden 's ) ) death ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( have spiked ) . ) ) ) ) )
( Oh ( , ( ( my God ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( those ( are ( ( just ( a few ) ) ( of ( ( the clips ) ( I ( collected ( over ( the ( last ( six months ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( -- ( ( could ( ( have easily ) ( been ( ( ( the ( last ( six days ) ) ) or ) ( the ( last ( six years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The point ) ( ( is ( that ( ( the ( news media ) ) ( preferentially ( ( feeds ( us ( negative stories ) ) ) ( because ( that ( 's ( what ( ( our minds ) ( ( pay attention ) to ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( there ( ( 's ( ( a ( ( very good ) reason ) ) ( for that ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Every second ) ( of ( every day ) ) ) ( , ( ( our senses ) ( ( ( bring ( in way ) ) ( ( ( too much ) data ) ( than ( we ( ( can possibly ) ( process ( in ( our brains ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( because ( nothing ( ( ( is ( more important ) ) ( to us ) ) ( than survival ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( the ( first stop ) ) ( of ( all ( of ( that data ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( an ( ancient sliver ) ) ( of ( ( the ( temporal lobe ) ) ( called ( the amygdala ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( Now ( ( ( the amygdala ) ( is ( our ( early ( warning detector ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( our ( danger detector ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( It sorts ) and ) ( scours ( through ( all ( of ( the information ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( looking ( for ( anything ( in ( ( the environment ) ( that ( might ( harm us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( ( given ( a ( dozen ( news stories ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( will preferentially ) ( look ( at ( the ( negative news ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( that ( old newspaper ) ) ( ( ( ( saying , ) `` ) ( ( ( If ( it ( bleeds it ) ) ) leads ) ( , ( '' ( is ( very true ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( ( given ( ( all ( of ( our ( digital devices ) ) ) ) ( that ( are ( ( ( ( ( bringing ( all ( the ( negative news ) ) ) ) ( to us ) ) ( ( seven days ) ( a week ) ) ) , ) ( ( 24 hours ) ( a day ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( 's ( ( no wonder ) ( that ( we ( 're pessimistic ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( no ( wonder ( that ( people ( think ( that ( ( the world ) ( is ( getting worse ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( perhaps ( that ( ( ( 's not ) ( the case ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Perhaps ( instead ( , ( it ( ( 's ( ( the distortions ) ( ( brought ( to us ) ) ( of ( what ( ( 's really ) ( going on ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( Perhaps ( ( ( the ( tremendous progress ) ) ( we ( 've ( ( made ( over ( the ( last century ) ) ) ) ( by ( ( a series ) ( of forces ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( are , ) ( in fact ) ) , ) ( accelerating ( to ( a ( point ( that ( we ( ( ( have ( the potential ) ) ( in ( the ( next ( three decades ) ) ) ) ) ( to ( create ( ( a world ) ( of abundance ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( we ( ( do n't ) ( have ( ( our set ) ( of problems ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( ( ( climate crisis ) , ) ( ( ( ( ( species extinction ) , ) water ) and ) ( energy shortage ) ) ) ) -- ) ( we ( surely do ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( And ( ( as humans ) ( , ( we ( are ( far ( better ( at ( ( seeing ( the ( problems way ) ) ) ( in advance ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ultimately ( we ( ( knock them ) down ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( ( let ( 's ( look ( at ( what ( this ( ( last century ) ( has ( been ( to ( see ( where ( we ( 're going ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Over ( the ( last ( hundred years ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the ( average ( human lifespan ) ) ) ( ( ( ( has ( ( more than ) doubled ) ) , ) ( average ( ( per capita ) ( ( income ( adjusted ( for ( inflation ( around ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) ( has tripled ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Childhood mortality ) ( ( has ( ( come down ) ( ( a factor ) ( of 10 ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Add ( to ( that ( ( ( the cost ) ( of ( ( ( ( ( ( food , ) electricity ) , ) transportation ) , ) communication ) ) ) ( have ( ( dropped 10 ) ( to 1,000-fold ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Steve Pinker ) ( ( has ( ( showed us ) ( ( that , ) ( ( in fact ) ( , ( we ( 're ( living ( during ( ( ( the ( ( most peaceful ) time ) ) ever ) ( in ( human history ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( Charles Kenny ) ( that ( ( global literacy ) ( has ( ( ( gone ( from ( 25 percent ) ) ) ( to ( ( over 80 ) percent ) ) ) ( in ( the ( last ( 130 years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( truly ( ( are ( living ( in ( an ( extraordinary time ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( many people ) ( ( forget this ) . ) ) )
( And ( we ( ( keep ( setting ( ( our expectations ) ( ( higher and ) higher ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( In fact ) ( , ( we ( ( redefine ( ( what poverty ) means ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( Think ( of this ) ) , ) ( ( in America ) ( today ( , ( ( ( the majority ) ( of ( people ( under ( the ( poverty line ) ) ) ) ) ) ( still ( have ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( electricity , ) water ) , ) toilets ) , ) refrigerators ) , ) television ) , ) ( mobile phones ) ) , ) ( air conditioning ) ) and ) cars ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( The ( wealthiest ( robber barons ) ) ) ( of ( the ( last century ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( the emperors ) ( on ( this planet ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( could ( ( have never ) ( dreamed ( of ( such luxuries ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( Underpinning much ) ( of this ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( technology , ) and ) ( of ( late ( , ( ( exponentially growing ) technologies ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( My ( good ( friend ( Ray Kurzweil ) ) ) ) ( ( showed ( that ( ( ( ( ( any tool ) ( that ( becomes ( ( an ( information technology ) ) ( ( ( jumps ( on ( this curve ) ) ) , ) ( on ( ( Moore 's ) Law ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( experiences ( price performance ) ) ( doubling ( every ( ( ( 12 to ) 24 ) months ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( That ( ( 's ( why ( ( ( the cellphone ) ( in ( your pocket ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( literally ( a ( million times ) ) ) cheaper ) and ) ) ( a ( ( ( thousand times ) faster ) ( than ( ( a supercomputer ) ( of ( the '70s ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( ( look ( at ( this curve ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( ( Moore 's ) Law ) ( over ( the ( last ( hundred years ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( want ( you ( to ( notice ( ( two things ) ( from ( this curve ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Number one ) , ) ( ( how smooth ) ( it ( is ( -- ( ( through ( ( ( good time ) and ) ( bad time ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( war time ) and ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( peace time ) , ) recession ) , ) depression ) and ) ( boom time ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( This ( ( is ( ( the result ) ( of ( ( faster computers ) ( being ( used ( to ( build ( faster computers ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( does n't ) ( slow ( for ( any ( of ( our ( grand challenges ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( also ( , ( ( even ( though ( it ( 's ( plotted ( on ( ( a ( log curve ) ) ( on ( the left ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( 's ( curving upwards ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( The rate ) ( ( at which ) ( ( the technology ) ( is ( getting ( faster ( ( is itself ) ( getting faster ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( on ( this curve ) ) ( , ( ( riding ( on ( ( Moore 's ) Law ) ) ) ( , ( ( are ( ( a set ) ( of ( ( ( extraordinarily powerful ) technologies ) ( available ( to ( all ( of us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( Cloud computing ) , ) ( ( ( what ( ( my friends ) ( at Autodesk ) ) ) ( call ( infinite computing ) ) ) ( ; ( ( sensors and ) networks ) ) ) ) ; ) robotics ) ; ) ( ( ( 3D printing ) , ) ( which ( is ( the ( ability ( to ( ( ( ( democratize and ) distribute ) ( personalized production ) ) ( around ( the planet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ; ( ( synthetic biology ) ( ; ( ( ( ( ( fuels , ) vaccines ) and ) foods ) ( ; ( ( digital medicine ) ( ; ( nanomaterials ( ; ( and A.I. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( I ( ( ( mean , ) ( ( ( how many ) ( of you ) ) ( ( saw ( ( the winning ) ( of Jeopardy ) ) ) ( by ( ( IBM 's ) Watson ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( I ( ( ( mean , ) ( that ( was epic ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In fact ) ( , ( I ( ( scoured ( ( the headlines ) ( looking ( for ( ( ( the ( best headline ) ) ( in ( a newspaper ) ) ) ( I could ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Jeopardy 's ) ( not ( an ( easy game ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( 's ( about ( ( the nuance ) ( of ( human language ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( imagine ( if ( ( ( you ( would ( ( A.I. 's ) ( like this ) ) ) ) ( on ( the cloud ) ) ) ( available ( to ( ( every person ) ( with ( a cellphone ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Four years ) ago ) ( here ( ( ( at ( ( TED , ) ( Ray Kurzweil ) ) ) and ) ( I ( started ( ( a ( new university ) ) ( called ( Singularity University ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( we ( ( ( ( ( ( teach ( our students ) ) ( all ( of ( these technologies ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( particularly ( how ( they ( can ( be ( used ( to ( solve ( ( humanity 's ) ( grand challenges ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( every year ) ( we ( ( ( ask them ) ( to ( start ( ( ( ( a company ) or ) ( ( ( a product ) or ) ( a service ) ) ) ( that ( can ( ( affect positively ) ( ( the lives ) ( of ( ( ( a billion ) people ) ( within ( a decade ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Think ( about that ) ) ( , ( ( the ( fact ( ( that , ) ( literally ( , ( ( ( a group ) ( of students ) ) ( can ( ( touch ( ( the lives ) ( of ( ( a billion ) people ) ) ) ) today ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( 30 years ) ago ) ( that ( ( would ( have ( sounded ludicrous ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Today ( we ( can ( point ( at ( dozens ( of ( companies ( that ( have ( done ( just that ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( When ( I ( think ( about ( creating abundance ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( 's not ) ( about ( ( creating ( ( a life ) ( of luxury ) ) ) ( for ( everybody ( on ( this planet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( it ( 's ( about ( creating ( ( a life ) ( of possibility ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( is ( about ( taking ( that ( which ( ( ( was scarce ) and ) ( making ( it abundant ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( You see ) , ) ( scarcity ( is contextual ) ) ) , ) and ) ( technology ( is ( a ( resource-liberating force ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Let ( me ( ( give you ) ( an example ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( this ( ( is ( ( a story ) ( of ( ( Napoleon III ) ( in ( the mid-1800s ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( He ( ( 's ( ( the dude ) ( on ( the left ) ) ) ) . ) )
( He ( ( ( invited over ) ( to ( dinner ( ( the king ) ( of Siam ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( All ( of ( ( Napoleon 's ) troops ) ) ) ( were ( fed ( with ( silver utensils ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( Napoleon himself ) ( with ( gold utensils ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( ( the King ) ( of Siam ) ) ( , ( he ( ( was ( fed ( with ( aluminum utensils ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( You see ) , ) ( aluminum ( ( was ( the ( ( most valuable ) metal ) ) ) ( on ( the planet ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( worth ( more ( than ( ( gold and ) platinum ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( 's ( the ( reason ( that ( ( ( the tip ) ( of ( the ( Washington Monument ) ) ) ) ( is ( made ( of aluminum ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( You ( ( see , ) ( even ( though ( aluminum ( ( is ( ( 8.3 percent ) ( of ( the Earth ) ) ) ) ( by mass ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( it ( ( does n't ) ( come ( as ( a ( pure metal ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( ( 's all ) ( bound ( by ( ( oxygen and ) silicates ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( then ( ( ( the technology ) ( of electrolysis ) ) ( ( ( ( came along ) and ) ( literally ( ( made aluminum ) ( ( so cheap ) ( that ( we ( ( use it ) ( with ( throw-away mentality ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( ( ( let ( 's project ) ) ( ( this analogy ) ( going forward ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( think ( about ( energy scarcity ) ) ) . ) )

( ( Others ( in ( ( medicine dread ) ( them ( ( ( ( as well ) , ) but ) ( there ( ( 's ( ( something particular ) ( about ( emergency medicine ) ) ) ) ( because ( we ( see ( patients ( so fleetingly ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( ( Slowly but ) surely ) ( , ( it ( lifted . ) ) ) )
( I ( ( began ( to ( feel ( ( a bit ) better ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( Two years ) later ) ( ( ( ( ( I ( was ( ( ( an attending ) ( in ( the ( emergency department ) ) ) ) ( at ( ( a ( community hospital ) ) ( just ( north ( of Toronto ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( I ( saw ( ( a ( 25 ( year-old man ) ) ) ( with ( a ( sore throat ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( It ( ( was busy ) , ) ) ( I ( was ( in ( ( a bit ) ( of ( a hurry ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( He ( ( kept ( pointing here ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( I ( looked ( at ( his throat ) ) ) ) , ) ( it ( was ( a ( little ( bit pink ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( I ( ( ( ( ( gave him ) ( ( a prescription ) ( for penicillin ) ) ) and ) ( ( sent him ) ( on ( his way ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( `` ( ( ( ( Do you ) ( remember ( ( that patient ) ( you ( saw ( with ( the ( sore throat ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) '' ) )
( ( Well ( it ( turns out ) ) ) ( , ( he ( ( ( did n't ) ( have ( a ( strep throat ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( He ( ( had ( ( a ( ( potentially life-threatening ) condition ) ) ( called epiglottitis ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( You ( can ( Google it ) ) ) , ) but ) ( it ( 's ( ( ( ( ( ( an infection ) , ) ( not ( ( ( ( of ( the throat ) ) , ) but ) ( of ( the ( upper airway ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( can actually ) ( cause ( ( the airway ) ( to close ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( fortunately ( he ( ( ( did n't ) die ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( He ( was ( placed ( on ( intravenous antibiotics ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( he ( recovered ( after ( a ( few days ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( I ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( went ( through ( ( the ( same period ) ) ( of ( ( shame and ) recriminations ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( felt cleansed ) ) and ) ( went ( back ( to work ) ) ) ) , ) ( until ( it ( ( ( happened again ) and ) ( ( again and ) again ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Twice ( in ( one ( emergency shift ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( missed appendicitis ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Now ( that ( takes ( some doing ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( especially when ) ( you ( ( ( work ( in ( a hospital ) ) ) that ) ( at ( the time ) ) ) ) ) ( ( saw but ) ( ( 14 people ) ( a night ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( Now ( in ( both cases ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( did n't ) ( ( send them ) home ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( I ( ( do n't ) ( think ( there ( was ( ( any gap ) ( in ( their care ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( One ( I ( thought ( had ( a ( kidney stone ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( The ( other one ) ) ( ( had ( ( a lot ) ( of diarrhea ) ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( ( ( ( ordered ( some fluids ) ) ( to ( rehydrate him ) ) ) and ) ( ( asked ( my colleague ) ) ( to ( reassess him ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( In ( both cases ) ) ( , ( they ( ( ( ( had ( their operations ) ) and ) ( they ( did okay ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( But ( ( each time ) ( , ( they ( ( ( ( ( were gnawing ) ( at me ) ) , ) ( eating ( at me ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( I ( 'd ( like ( to ( be ( able ( to ( ( say ( to you ) ) ( that ( ( my ( worst mistakes ) ) ( only ( ( ( ( happened ( in ( ( the ( first ( five years ) ) ) ( of practice ) ) ) ) ( as ( ( many ( of ( my colleagues ) ) ) say ) ) ) , ) ( which ( is ( total B.S. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( Some ( of ( my doozies ) ) ) ( ( have ( been ( in ( the ( last ( five years ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Alone ( , ( ( ashamed and ) unsupported ) ) ) . )
( How ( ( ( can I ) ( ( teach them ) ( about ( what ( I ( ( did so ) ( that ( they ( ( do n't ) ( do ( the ( same thing ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( If ( I ( were ( to ( walk ( into ( ( a room ) ( -- ( ( like ( right now ) ) ( , ( I ( have ( ( no idea ) ( what ( you ( think ( of me ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( Oh yeah ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( ( you ( go ( to ( a ( cocktail party ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( you ( might ( hear ( about ( some ( other doctor ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( you ( ( 're not ) ( going ( to ( hear ( somebody ( talking ( about ( their ( own mistakes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( If ( I ( were ( to ( ( ( walk ( into ( ( a room ) ( filled ( with ( my colleages ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ask ( for ( ( their support ) ( ( ( right now ) and ) ( start ( to ( tell ( what ( I ( ( 've just ) ( ( told you ) ( right now ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( probably ( ( would n't ) ( ( get ( through ( two ( of ( those stories ) ) ) ) ) ( before ( they ( would ( start ( to ( get ( really uncomfortable ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( somebody ( would ( crack ( a joke ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( ( ( 'd ( change ( the subject ) ) ) and ) ( we ( would ( move on ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( in fact ) ( , ( ( if ( ( ( I knew ) and ) ( ( my colleagues ) ( knew ( that ( ( one ( of ( my ( orthopedic colleagues ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( took off ) ( ( the ( wrong leg ) ) ( in ( my hospital ) ) ) ) , ) ( believe me ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( 'd ( have ( trouble ( making ( ( eye contact ) ( with ( that person ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( That ( ( 's ( ( the system ) ( that ( we have ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a ( complete denial ) ) ( of mistakes ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a system ) ( ( in which ) ( there ( are ( ( ( two kinds ) ( of physicians ) ) ( -- ( ( ( ( ( those ( who ( make mistakes ) ) ) and ) ( those ( who ( do n't ) ) ) ) , ) ( those ( who ( ( ( ( ca n't ) ( handle ( sleep deprivation ) ) ) and ) ( those ( who ( ( can , ) ( those ( who ( ( ( have ( lousy outcomes ) ) and ) ( those ( who ( have ( great outcomes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( it ( ( 's ( almost ( like ( ( ( an ( ideological reaction ) ) , ) ( like ( ( the antibodies ) ( begin ( to ( attack ( that person ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( And ( we ( ( ( ( have ( this ( idea ( that ( ( ( if ( we ( drive ( ( the people ) ( who ( ( make mistakes ) ( out ( of medicine ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( what ( ( will we ) ( be ( left with ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( a ( safe system ) ) ) ) ) . )
( But ( there ( ( are ( ( two problems ) ( with that ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( In ( ( my ( 20 ( years ( or so ) ) ) ) ( of ( ( ( medical broadcasting ) and ) journalism ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( ( 've ( ( made ( ( a ( personal study ) ) ( of ( ( ( medical malpractice ) and ) ( medical errors ) ) ) ) ) ( to ( learn ( everything ( I ( ( can , ) ( from ( one ( of ( ( the ( first articles ) ) ( I ( wrote ( for ( ( ( ( ( ( the ( Toronto Star ) ) ( to ( my show ) ) ) `` ) ( White Coat ) ) , ) ( Black Art ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) ) )
( And ( ( what ( I ( 've learned ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( errors ( are ( absolutely ubiquitous ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( We ( ( work ( in ( ( a system ) ( where ( errors ( happen ( ( ( every day ) , ) ( where ( ( one ( in ( 10 medications ) ) ) ( ( are either ) ( ( ( ( the ( wrong medication ) ) ( given ( in hospital ) ) ) or ) ( at ( ( ( the ( wrong dosage ) ) , ) ( where ( ( hospital-acquired infections ) ( are ( ( ( getting ( ( more and ) ( more numerous ) ) ) , ) ( causing ( ( havoc and ) death ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In ( this country ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( as many ) as ) 24,000 ) Canadians ) ( ( die ( of ( preventable ( medical errors ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( In ( the ( United States ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( the Institute ) ( of Medicine ) ) ( ( ( pegged it ) ( at 100,000 ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( In ( both cases ) ) ( , ( these ( ( ( ( are ( gross underestimates ) ) , ) ( because ( we ( really ( ( are n't ) ( ( ( ferreting out ) ( the problem ) ) ( as ( we should ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( here ( ( 's ( the thing ) ) . ) ) )
( ( In ( ( a ( hospital system ) ) ( where ( ( medical knowledge ) ( is ( doubling ( every ( ( ( two or ) three ) years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( ca n't ) ( ( keep up ) ( with it ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Sleep deprivation ) ( ( is ( absolutely pervasive ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( ca n't ) ( get ( rid ( of it ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( We ( have ( our ( cognitive biases ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( that ( I ( can ( take ( ( a ( perfect history ) ) ( on ( ( a patient ) ( with ( chest pain ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Now ( ( take ( the ( same patient ) ) ) ( with ( chest pain ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( make ( ( ( them moist ) and ) ( ( ( ( ( garrulous and ) ( ( put ( ( a ( little bit ) ) ( of alcohol ) ) ) ( on ( their breath ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( suddenly ( ( my history ) ( is ( laced ( with contempt ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( ( do n't ) ( take ( the ( same history ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( I ( ( 'm not ) ( a robot ) ) ) ; ) ( I ( ( do n't ) ( ( ( do things ) ( the ( same way ) ) ) ( each time ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( And ( ( my patients ) ( ( are n't ) cars ) ) ) ; ) ( they ( ( do n't ) ( ( ( tell me ) ( their symptoms ) ) ( in ( ( the ( same way ) ) ( each time ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Given ( all ( of that ) ) ) ( , ( mistakes ( ( are inevitable ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( ( ( ( ( if ( you ( take ( the system ) ) ) ) , ) ( as ( I ( was taught ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( ( weed out ) ( ( ( all ( the ( error-prone ( health professionals ) ) ) ) , ) ( well ( there ( ( wo n't ) ( be ( anybody left ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( And ( you ( know ( that ( business ( about ( people ( not ( wanting ( to ( talk ( about ( their ( worst cases ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( and ( I ( ( would ( ( point ( the microphone ) ) ( towards them ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( ( their pupils ) ( would dilate ) ) ( , ( they ( ( would ( ( recoil , ) ( then ( they ( would ( ( ( look down ) and ) ( swallow ( ( hard and ) ( start ( to ( ( tell me ) ( their stories ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( They ( want ( to ( be ( able ( to say ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) `` ) Look ) , ) ( ( do n't ) ( make ( ( the ( same mistake ) ) ( I did ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' )
( ( What ( they ( need ( is ( ( an environment ) ( to ( be ( able ( to ( do that ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( What ( they need ) ) ( ( is ( a ( redefined ( medical culture ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( it ( ( ( starts ( with ( one physician ) ) ) ( at ( a time ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( The ( redefined physician ) ) ( is human ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( knows ( she ( 's human ) ) ) , ) ( accepts it ) ) , ) ( ( ( ( ( is n't ) ( proud ( of ( making mistakes ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( strives ( to ( ( learn ( one thing ) ) ( from ( what ( happened ( that ( she ( can ( teach ( to ( somebody else ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( She ( ( ( shares ( her experience ) ) ( with others ) ) . ) )
( She ( ( ( 's supportive ) ( when ( ( other people ) ( talk ( about ( their mistakes ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( she ( ( ( points out ) ( ( ( other ( ( people 's ) mistakes ) ) , ) ( ( ( not ( in ( a ( gotcha way ) ) ) ) , ) ( but ( in ( ( a ( ( ( loving , ) supportive ) way ) ) ( so ( that ( everybody ( can benefit ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( she ( ( ( ( works ( in ( ( a culture ) ( of ( medicine ( that ( acknowledges ( that ( ( human beings ) ( run ( the system ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( when ( ( human beings ) ( run ( the system ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( will ( ( make mistakes ) ( from ( time ( to time ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( ( ( ( ( the system ) ( is ( evolving ( to ( create ( backups ( that ( make ( it ( easier ( to ( detect ( ( those mistakes ) ( that ( humans ( inevitably ( ( make and ) ( also ( fosters ( ( ( ( in ( ( a ( loving ( , ( supportive ( way places ) ) ) ) ) ( where ( ( everybody ( who ( is ( observing ( in ( the ( health ( care system ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( can actually ) ( ( point out ) ( things ( that ( ( ( could ( be ( potential mistakes ) ) ) and ) ( is ( rewarded ( for ( doing so ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( ( especially people ) ( like me ) ) , ) ( when ( we ( do ( make mistakes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( we ( 're ( rewarded ( for ( coming clean ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( My name ) ( ( is ( Brian Goldman ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( am ( a ( redefined physician ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( I ( 'm ( sorry ( about that ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( strive ( to ( learn ( ( one thing ) ( that ( I ( can ( ( pass on ) ( to ( other people ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( I ( still ( ( do n't ) ( know ( what ( you ( think ( of me ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( can ( live ( with that ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( 's true ) . ) )
( ( So ( we ( 're ( going ( to ( ( ( talk ( a ( little bit ) ) ) today ) ( about ( ( ( how ( videos ( go viral ) ) ) and ) ( then ( why ( that ( even matters ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( We all ) ( ( want ( to ( be ( ( stars ( -- ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( celebrities , ) singers ) , ) comedians ) -- ) and ) ( when ( I ( was younger ) ) ) ) , ) ) ) ( that ( seemed ( ( so very ) ( , ( very ( hard ( to do ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( now ( ( Web video ) ( ( has ( ( made it ) ( so ( that ( ( ( ( any ( of us ) ) or ) ( any ( of ( ( the ( creative things ) ) ( that ( we do ) ) ) ) ) ) ( can ( become ( completely ( famous ( in ( ( a part ) ( of ( ( our ( world 's ) ) culture ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Any one ) ( of you ) ) ( ( could ( ( ( be famous ) ( on ( the Internet ) ) ) ( by ( next Saturday ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( there ( ( ( are ( over ( ( 48 hours ) ( of video ) ) ) ) ( ( uploaded ( to YouTube ) ) ( every minute ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( of that ) ( , ( ( only ( a ( tiny percentage ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ever ( ( ( goes viral ) and ) ( gets ( tons ( of views ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( becomes ( a ( cultural moment ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( how ( ( ( does it ) happen ) ? ) ) )
( ( All right ) ( , ( ( let ( 's go ) ) . ) ) )
( Oh ( , ( ( my God ) ! ) ) )
( ( ( Ohhhhh , ) wowwww ) ! )
( ( Last year ) ( , ( ( Bear Vasquez ) ( ( ( posted ( this video ) ) ( that ( he ( had ( shot ( outside ( ( his home ) ( in ( Yosemite ( National Park ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( In 2010 ) ( , ( it ( ( was ( viewed ( 23 ( million times ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( a chart ) ( of ( what ( it ( ( looked like ) ( when ( it ( first ( ( became popular ) ( last summer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( ( he ( ( did n't ) ( actually ( ( set out ) ( to ( make ( a ( viral video ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , Bear ) ) . ) )
( He ( just ( ( wanted ( to ( share ( a rainbow ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Because ( that ( 's ( what ( you ( do ( when ( ( your name ) ( is ( Yosemite ( Mountain Bear ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( he ( ( had ( ( posted ( lots ( of ( nature videos ) ) ) ) ( in fact ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( this video ) ( ( ( had actually ) ( been ( ( ( posted ( all ( the way ) ) ) back ) ( in January ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( what ( ( happened here ) ? ) ) )
( ( Jimmy Kimmel ) ( actually . ) )
( ( Jimmy Kimmel ) ( ( posted ( ( this tweet ) ( that ( ( would eventually ) ( propel ( ( the video ) ( to ( be ( ( as popular ) ( as ( it ( would become ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Because ( ( tastemakers ( like ( Jimmy Kimmel ) ) ) ( ( ( ( introduce us ) ( to ( ( ( new and ) interesting ) things ) ) ) and ) ( ( bring them ) ( to ( a ( larger audience ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Rebecca ( Black 's ) ) ( `` ( Friday ( '' ( ( is ( one ( of ( ( the ( ( most popular ) videos ) ) ( of ( the year ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( been ( ( seen ( ( nearly ( 200 million ) ) times ) ) ( this year ) ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( a chart ) ( of ( what ( it ( looked like ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( And ( similar ( to ( `` ( ( ( ( Double Rainbow ) , ) '' ) ( it ( seems ( ( ( to have ) just ) ( ( sprouted up ) ( out ( of nowhere ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( So ( what ( happened ( on ( this day ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( Well ( it ( was ( a Friday ) ) ) ) ( , ( this ( ( is true ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( if ( you ( 're ( wondering ( about ( those ( other spikes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( those ( ( ( are also ) Fridays ) . ) ) ) ) )
( But ( ( what ( about ( this day ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( this one ) ( particular Friday ) ) ? ) ) ) )
( Well ( ( Tosh .0 ) ( ( ( ( ( picked it ) up ) , ) ( ( a lot ) ( of ( blogs ( starting ( writing about ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( what ( 's important ) ) ( ( ( ( is ( that ( ( ( ( an individual ) or ) ( ( a group ) ( of tastemakers ) ) ) ( took ( ( a point ) ( of view ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( they ( shared ( that ( ( with ( a ( larger audience ) ) ) ( , ( accelerating ( the process ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( so then ) ( ( this community ) ( ( ( ( formed ( of ( people ( who ( shared ( this ( big ( inside joke ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( they ( ( ( started ( talking ( about it ) ) ) and ) ( ( doing things ) ( with it ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( now ( there ( ( ( are ( ( 10,000 parodies ) ( ( ( of `` ) Friday ) '' ) ) ) ( on YouTube ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Even ( in ( the ( first ( seven days ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( there ( ( was ( ( one parody ) ( for ( ( every ( other day ) ) ( of ( the week ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Unlike ( ( the ( one-way entertainment ) ) ( of ( the ( 20th century ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( this ( community participation ) ) ( ( is ( how ( we ( ( ( become ( ( a part ) ( of ( the phenomenon ) ) ) ) -- ) ( either ( by ( ( spreading ( it or ) ) ( by ( doing ( something ( new ( with it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( ( `` ( Nyan ( Cat '' ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( a ( looped animation ) ) ( with ( looped music ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( ( ( 's this ) , ) ( just ( like this ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( 's ( been ( ( viewed ( ( nearly ( 50 million ) ) times ) ) ( this year ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( if ( you ( think ( that ( that ( is weird ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( should ( know ( that ( there ( is ( ( ( a ( three-hour version ) ) ( of this ) ) ( that ( 's ( been ( viewed ( four ( million times ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Even cats ) ( ( were ( watching ( this video ) ) ) . ) )

( But ( ( what ( ( 's important ) here ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( ( the creativity ) ( that ( it ( inspired ( amongst ( this techie ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( geeky ( Internet culture ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( There ( ( were remixes ) . ) )
( Someone ( ( made ( an ( old ( timey version ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( then ( it ( ( went international ) . ) ) ) )
( ( An ( entire ( remix community ) ) ) ( ( ( sprouted up ) ( that ( ( ( brought it ) ( from ( being ( just ( a ( stupid joke ) ) ) ) ) ) ( to ( something ( that ( we ( ( ( can all ) actually ) ( be ( ( a part ) of ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Because ( we ( ( ( do n't ) just ) ( enjoy now ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( we participate ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( who ( could ( have ( predicted ( any ( of this ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( Who ( could ( have ( predicted ( ( ( `` ( ( ( ( Double Rainbow ) '' ) or ) ( Rebecca Black ) ) ) or ) ( `` ( ( ( Nyan Cat ) ? ) '' ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( What scripts ) ( ( ( could you ) ( have ( written ( that ( would ( have ( ( contained this ) ( in it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( In ( ( a world ) ( where ( ( over ( ( two days ) ( of video ) ) ) ( get ( ( ( uploaded ( every minute ) ) , ) ( only ( ( that which ) ( ( is ( ( ( truly unique ) and ) unexpected ) ) ( can ( ( stand out ) ( in ( ( the way ) ( that ( ( these things ) have ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( When ( ( ( a friend ) ( of mine ) ) ( ( told me ) ( that ( I ( needed ( to ( see ( ( this ( great video ) ) ( about ( ( a guy ) ( ( protesting ( bicycle fines ) ) ( in ( New ( York City ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( admit ( I ( ( was n't ) ( very interested ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( ( ( ( ( I ( got ( ( a ticket ) ( for ( not ( riding ( in ( the ( bike lane ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( often ( there ( are ( obstructions ( that ( ( keep you ) ( from ( properly ( riding ( in ( the ( bike lane ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( What ( ( ( does this ) mean ) ? ) )
( What ( ( ( does it ) mean ) ? ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( Tastemakers , ) ( creative ( participating communities ) ) ) , ) ( complete unexpectedness ) ) , ) ( ( ( these ( are ( characteristics ( of ( ( a ( new kind ) ) ( of media ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( ( a ( new kind ) ) ( of culture ) ) ( where ( anyone ( has ( ( access and ) ( the audience ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defines ( the popularity ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( No one ) ( ( has ( to ( green-light ( your idea ) ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( ( ( ( ( these ( ( ( ( ( are not ) ( characteristics ( of ( old media ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they ( 're ( ( barely true ) ( of ( ( the media ) ( of today ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( they ( will ( define ( ( the entertainment ) ( of ( the future ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( Today ( I ( ( 'm ( going ( to ( talk ( about ( unexpected discoveries ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( I ( ( work ( in ( the ( solar ( technology industry ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( my ( small startup ) ) ( is ( looking ( to ( ( ( force ourselves ) ( into ( the environment ) ) ) ( by ( ( paying attention ) ( to ... ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( just ( a ( quick video ) ) ) ( of ( what ( we do ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( might ( ( take ( a moment ) ) ( to load ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( 'll just ) ( -- ( ( we ( ( can just ) skip ) ) -- ) ) ) ( I ( ( 'll just ) ( skip ( through ( ( ( the video ) instead ) ... ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( This ( ( is not ) ... ) )
( ( Solar technology ) ( is ... ) )
( Oh ( , ( that ( ( 's ( all ( my time ) ) ) ? ) ) ) )
( ( My story ) ( ( ( ( ( begins ( right here ) ) actually ) ( in Rajasthan ) ) ( ( about ( two years ) ) ago ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( ( ( was ( in ( the desert ) ) ) , ) ( under ( ( the ( starry skies ) ) ( with ( the ( Sufi ( singer ( Mukhtiar Ali ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( we ( ( ( ( were ( in conversation ) ) ( about ( how ( nothing ( had ( changed ( since ( ( the time ) ( of ( ( ( the ( ancient ( Indian epic ) ) ) `` ) ( The Mahabharata ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) )
( ( ( ( So ( ( ( back ( in ( the day ) ) ) , ) ( when ( us ( Indians ( wanted ( to ( travel ( we ( 'd ( jump ( into ( a chariot ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( we ( 'd ( zoom ( across ( the sky ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Now ( we ( ( ( do ( the same ) ) ( with airplanes ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Back then ) ( , ( ( when ( ( ( ( ( Arjuna , ) ( the ( great ( Indian ( warrior prince ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( when ( he ( was thirsty ) ) ) ) ( , ( he ( 'd ( ( take out ) ( a bow ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( he ( 'd ( ( shoot it ) ( into ( the ( ( ground and ) water ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( would ( come out ) ) . ) )
( Now ( we ( ( ( do ( the same ) ) ( with ( ( drills and ) machines ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The ( conclusion ( that ( we ( came to ) ) ) ) ) ( ( was ( that ( magic ( had ( been ( replaced ( by machinery ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( this ( ( ( made me ) ( really sad ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( found ( myself ( becoming ( ( a ( little bit ) ) ( of ( a technophobe ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( was ( ( terrified ( by ( this idea ) ) ) ( that ( I ( would ( lose ( the ( ability ( to ( ( enjoy and ) ( ( appreciate ( the sunset ) ) ( without ( ( ( ( having ( my camera ) ) ( on me ) ) , ) ( without ( ( tweeting it ) ( to ( my friends ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( it ( ( ( felt ( like technology ) ) ( should ( enable ( magic ( , ( not ( kill it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( When ( I ( was ( a ( little girl ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( my grandfather ) ( ( ( gave me ) ( his ( little ( silver ( pocket watch ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( ( this piece ) ( of ( 50-year-old technology ) ) ) ( ( ( became ( the ( ( most magical ) thing ) ) ) ( to me ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( ( ( became ( a ( gilded gateway ) ) ) ( into ( ( a world ) ( full ( of ( ( ( ( pirates and ) shipwrecks ) and ) images ) ) ) ) ) ) ( in ( my imagination ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( ( ( I ( felt ( like ( ( ( our cellphones ) and ) ( our ( fancy watches ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( our cameras ) ( had ( ( stopped us ) ( from dreaming ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( They ( ( ( stopped us ) ( from ( being inspired ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( so ( I ( ( ( ( jumped in ) , ) ( I ( ( ( jumped ( into ( ( this world ) ( of technology ) ) ) ) , ) ( to ( see ( how ( I ( could ( ( use it ) ( to ( enable ( magic ( as ( opposed ( to ( kill it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( I ( ( 've ( been ( ( illustrating books ) ( since ( I ( was 16 ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( so ( ( when ( I ( saw ( the iPad ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( ( saw it ) ( as ( ( a ( storytelling device ) ) ( that ( could ( ( connect readers ) ( all ( over ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( It ( ( can ( know ( how ( we ( 're ( holding it ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( can ( know ( where ( we are ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( brings together ) ( ( ( image ( and ( ( text and ) animation ) ) ) and ) ( ( sound and ) touch ) ) ) . ) )
( Storytelling ( ( is ( becoming ( ( more and ) ( more multi-sensorial ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( what ( ( ( are we ) ( doing ( with it ) ) ) ? ) ) )
( So ( I ( ( ( 'm actually ) ( just ( going ( to ( ( ( go in ) and ) ( ( ( launch Khoya ) , ) ( ( an ( interactive app ) ) ( for ( the iPad ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( ( it says ) ( , ( ( ( `` ( ( Place ( your fingers ) ) ( upon ( each light ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) ) )
( And ( actually ( I ( ( become ( ( a character ) ( in ( the book ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( At ( various points ) ) ( , ( ( a ( little letter ) ) ( ( ( ( ( drops ( down ( to me ) ) ) -- ) and ) ( ( the iPad ) ( knows ( where ( you ( live ( because ( of ( ( GPS -- ) ( which ( ( is actually ) ( addressed ( to me ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( The child ) ( in me ) ) ( ( ( is really ) ( excited ( by ( ( these kinds ) ( of possibilities ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( I ( ( 've ( been ( talking ( ( a lot ) ( about magic ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( And ( I ( ( ( ( do n't ) ( mean ( ( wizards and ) dragons ) ) ) , ) ( I ( mean ( ( the kind ) ( of ( childhood magic ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( those ideas ) ( that ( ( we all ) ( harbored ( as children ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( This idea ) ( of fireflies ) ) ( in ( a jar ) ) ) , ) ( for ( some reason ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( was always ) ( really ( exciting ( to me ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( so ( ( over here ) ( you ( need ( to ( tilt ( your iPad ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( take ( the fireflies ) ) out ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( they ( actually ( ( ( illuminate ( your way ) ) ( through ( ( the rest ) ( of ( the book ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Another idea ) ( that ( really ( ( fascinated me ) ( as ( ( a child ) ( was ( that ( ( an ( entire galaxy ) ) ( could ( be ( contained ( within ( a ( single marble ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( so ( over here ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( each book ) and ) ( each world ) ) ( ( becomes ( ( a ( little marble ) ) ( that ( I ( ( drag in ) ( to ( ( this ( magical device ) ) ( within ( the device ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( it ( ( ( opens up ) ( a map ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( All along ) , ) ( all ( fantasy books ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( have always ) ( had maps ) ) , ) but ) ( ( these maps ) ( have ( been static ) ) ) ) ) . )
( This ( ( is ( ( a map ) ( that ( ( ( ( grows and ) glows ) and ) ( becomes ( ( your navigation ) ( for ( ( the rest ) ( of ( the book ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( ( reveals itself ) ( to you ) ) ( at ( ( certain points ) ( in ( ( the book ) ( as well ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( I ( ( 'm ( just ( going ( to ( enter in ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Another thing ) ( that ( ( 's actually ) ( really ( important ( to me ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( creating ( content ( that ( ( ( is Indian ) and ) ( yet ( very contemporary ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Over here ) ( , ( these ( ( are ( the Apsaras ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( we ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( 've all ) ( heard ( about fairies ) ) ) and ) ( we ( ( 've all ) ( heard ( about nymphs ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ( ( ( how many ) people ) ( outside ( of India ) ) ) ( know ( about ( their ( Indian counterparts ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( the Apsaras ) ) ? ) ) )
( ( These ( poor Apsaras ) ) ( ( have ( been ( ( trapped ( inside ( ( Indra 's ) chambers ) ) ) ( for ( ( thousands ( of years ) ) ( in ( an ( ( ( old and ) musty ) book ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( so ( we ( ( 're ( ( ( bringing them ) back ) ( in ( ( a ( contemporary story ) ) ( for children ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( ( a story ) ( that ( actually ( deals ( with ( ( new issues ) ( like ( the ( environmental crisis ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Speaking ( of ( the ( environmental crisis ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( I ( think ( ( a ( big problem ) ) ( has ( been ( in ( the ( last ( 10 years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( is ( ( that ( children ( have ( been ( locked ( inside ( their rooms ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( glued ( to ( their PCs ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( ( have n't ) ( been ( able ( to ( get out ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( But ( now ( ( with ( mobile technology ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( can actually ) ( ( ( take ( our children ) ) outside ) ( into ( ( the ( natural world ) ) ( with ( their technology ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( One ( of ( the interactions ) ) ) ( in ( the book ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( that ( you ( 're ( ( sent off ) ( on ( ( this quest ) ( where ( you ( need ( to ( go outside ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( take out ) ( your camera ) ) ( on ( the iPad ) ) ) and ) ( collect ( pictures ( of ( different ( natural objects ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( When ( I ( was ( a child ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( had ( ( multiple collections ) ( of ( ( ( ( ( ( sticks and ) stones ) and ) pebbles ) and ) shells ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( somehow ( kids ( ( ( do n't ) ( ( do that ) anymore ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( ( ( ( ( in ( ( bringing back ) ( this ( childhood ritual ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( need ( to ( ( ( ( go out ) and ) , ) ( ( in ( one chapter ) ) ( , ( take ( ( a picture ) ( of ( a flower ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( then ( tag it ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In ( another chapter ) ) ( , ( you ( ( ( ( need ( to ( take ( ( a picture ) ( of ( ( a piece ) ( of bark ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( then ( tag that ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( what happens ) ( ( is ( that ( you ( actually ( create ( ( ( a ( digital collection ) ) ( of photographs ) ) ( that ( you ( ( can then ) ( ( put up ) online ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( A child ) ( in London ) ) ( ( ( ( puts up ) ( ( a picture ) ( of ( a fox ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( says , ) `` ) ( Oh ( , ( I ( ( ( ( saw ( a fox ) ) today ) . ) '' ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( A child ) ( in India ) ) ( ( ( ( ( says , ) `` ) ( I ( ( saw ( a monkey ) ) today ) ) ) . ) '' ) )
( And ( it ( ( creates ( ( ( this kind ) ( of ( social network ) ) ) ( around ( ( ( a collection ) ( of ( digital photographs ) ) ) ( that ( you ( ( 've actually ) taken ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( In ( ( the possibilities ) ( of ( ( linking together ) magic ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the earth ) and ) technology ) , ) there ) ( are ( multiple possibilities ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( In ( the ( next book ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( plan ( on ( having ( ( an interaction ) ( where ( you ( ( ( take ( your iPad ) ) out ) ( with ( ( the video ) ( ( on and ) ( through ( augmented reality ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( you ( see ( ( this layer ) ( of ( animated pixies ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( appear ( on ( ( a houseplant ) ( that ( 's ( outside ( your house ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( At ( one point ) ) ( , ( ( your screen ) ( ( is ( ( filled up ) ( with leaves ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( so ( you ( ( need ( to ( ( ( make ( ( the sound ) ( of wind ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( ( blow them ) away ) and ) ( read ( ( the rest ) ( of ( the book ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( We ( 're moving ) ) , ) ( we ( ( 're all ) ( ( ( moving here ) , ) ( to ( ( a world ) ( where ( ( ( the forces ) ( of nature ) ) ( come ( ( closer together ) ( to technology ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( magic and ) technology ) ( can ( come ( closer together ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( 're ( ( harnessing energy ) ( from ( the sun ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( We ( 're ( bringing ( our children ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( ourselves ( closer ( to ( the ( natural world ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( that ( ( magic and ) ( ( ( joy and ) childhood ) ( love ( that ( we ( had ( through ( ( the ( simple medium ) ) ( of ( a story ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( ( So ( ( ( ( ( a couple ) ( of years ) ) ( ago ( I ( started ( ( a program ) ( to ( try ( to ( ( ( get ( ( ( ( the ( rockstar tech ) ) and ) ( design people ) ) ( to ( ( take ( a year ) ) off ) ) ) ) and ) ( work ( in ( ( the ( one environment ) ) ( that ( represents ( ( ( pretty much ) everything ) ( they ( 're ( supposed ( to hate ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( we ( have ( them ( work ( in government ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( The program ) ( is ( called ( Code ( for America ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( 's ( ( a ( little bit ) ) ( like ( ( a ( Peace Corps ) ) ( for geeks ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( We ( select ( ( a ( few fellows ) ) ( every year ) ) ) ) and ) ( we ( have ( them ( work ( with ( city governments ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Instead ( of ( ( ( sending them ) off ) ( into ( the ( Third World ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( send them ) ( into ( ( the wilds ) ( of ( City Hall ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( there ( they ( make ( great apps ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( work ( with ( city staffers ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( But ( really ( ( ( what ( they ( 're doing ) ) ) ( is ( they ( 're ( showing ( what ( ( ( 's possible ) ( with technology ) ) today ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( ( meet Al. ) . ) )
( Al ( ( is ( ( a ( fire hydrant ) ) ( in ( ( the city ) ( of Boston ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Here ( it ( ( ( ( ( kind ( of ( looks ( like ( he ( 's ( looking ( for ( a date ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( what ( he ( ( 's really ) ( looking ( for ( is ( for ( ( ( someone ( to shovel ) ) ( him out ) ) ( ( when ( he ( gets ( snowed in ) ) ) ) ( , ( because ( he ( knows ( he ( ( ( 's not ) ( very ( good ( at ( fighting fires ) ) ) ) ) ( when ( he ( 's ( covered ( in ( ( four feet ) ( of snow ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( how ( ( ( did he ) ( come ( to ( be ( looking ( for ( help ( in ( this ( ( very unique ) manner ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) ) )
( We ( ( ( ( ( had ( ( a team ) ( of ( fellows ( in Boston ) ) ) ) ) ( last year ) ) ( through ( the Code ) ) ) ( for ( America program ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( were ( ( ( ( there ( in February ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( ( snowed ( a lot ) ) ( in February ) ) ( last year ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( they ( ( noticed ( that ( ( the city ) ( never ( gets ( to ( digging ( out ( these ( fire hydrants ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( ( ( ( ( one fellow ) ( in particular ) ) , ) ( ( a guy ) ( named ( Erik Michaels-Ober ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( ( ( noticed ( something else ) ) , ) and ) ( that ( 's ( that ( citizens ( are ( ( ( shoveling out ) sidewalks ) ( right ( in ( front ( of ( these things ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( he ( did ( ( ( what any ) ( ( good developer ) ( would do ) ) ) ( , ( he ( wrote ( an app ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a ( cute ( little app ) ) ) ( where ( you ( can ( adopt ( a ( fire hydrant ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( you ( ( agree ( to ( ( ( dig it ) out ) ( when ( it snows ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( If ( you do ) ) ( , ( you ( get ( to ( name it ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( he ( called ( the ( first ( one Al. ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( if ( you ( do n't ) ) ) ( , ( someone ( ( can ( ( steal it ) ( from you ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( it ( ( 's ( got ( ( cute ( little ( game dynamics ) ) ) ( on it ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( a ( modest ( little app ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( 's probably ) ( ( ( the smallest ) ( of ( the ( 21 apps ) ) ) ) ( that ( ( the fellows ) ( wrote ( last year ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( it ( ( 's ( doing ( something ( that ( ( no ( other ( government technology ) ) ) does ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( spreading virally ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( It ( ( 's ( very important ) ) ( that ( ( these ( tsunami sirens ) ) work ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( people ( ( steal ( the batteries ) ) ( out ( of them ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( he ( ( 's ( ( getting citizens ) ( to ( check ( on them ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( then ( Seattle ( ( ( decided ( to ( ( use it ) ( to ( get ( citizens ( to ( ( clear out ) ( clogged storm ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) drains ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( Chicago ( just ( ( ( ( rolled it ) out ) ( to ( get ( people ( to ( ( ( sign up ) ( to ( shovel sidewalks ) ) ) ( when ( it snows ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( we ( now ( ( know ( of ( ( nine cities ) ( that ( are ( planning ( to ( use this ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( this ( ( has ( ( ( ( ( spread ( just frictionlessly ) ) , ) organically ) , ) naturally ) ) . ) ) )
( ( If ( you ( know ( anything ( about ( government technology ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( know ( that ( this ( ( is n't ) ( how ( it ( normally goes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Procuring ( software ( usually ( takes ( ( a couple ) ( of years ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( had ( ( a team ) ( that ( ( ( worked ( on ( ( a project ) ( in Boston ) ) ) ) ( last year ) ) ( that ( ( ( took ( ( three people ) ( about two ) ) ) and ) ( a ( half months ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( was ( ( a way ) ( that ( parents ( could ( ( figure out ) ( which ( were ( ( the ( right ( public schools ) ) ) ( for ( their kids ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( were ( ( told afterward ) ( that ( ( ( ( if ( that ( had ( gone ( through ( normal channels ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( would ( have ( taken ( ( ( at least ) two ) years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( it ( would ( have ( cost ( ( ( about two ) million ) dollars ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( that ( ( 's nothing ) . ) ) )
( There ( ( ( ( is ( ( one project ) ( in ( the ( California ( court system ) ) ) ) ) ) ( right now ) ) ( that ( ( so far ) ( ( cost taxpayers ) ( ( ( ( ( two billion ) dollars ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( does n't ) work ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( there ( ( are ( ( projects ( like this ) ) ( at ( ( every level ) ( of government ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( ( ( ( an app ) ( that ( ( ( ( takes ( ( a couple ) ( of days ) ) ) ( to write ) ) and ) ( then ( spreads virally ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( that ( 's ( sort ( of ( ( ( a shot ) ( across ( the bow ) ) ) ( to ( ( the institution ) ( of government ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( suggests ( how ( government ( could ( ( ( work better ) -- ) ( ( ( not more ) ( like ( a ( private company ) ) ) ) ( , ( as ( ( many people ) ( think ( it should ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( not ( ( ( ( ( even ( like ( a ( tech company ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( more ( like ( ( the Internet ) itself ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( And ( that ( ( means permissionless ) , ) ) ) ( it ( means ( open ( , ( it ( means generative ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( that ( ( 's important ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( what ( ( 's ( more important ) ) ( about ( this app ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( it ( represents ( how ( ( a ( new generation ) ) ( is ( ( ( tackling ( ( the problem ) ( of government ) ) ) -- ) ( ( ( ( not ( as ( ( the problem ) ( of ( an ( ossified institution ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( as ( ( a problem ) ( of ( collective action ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( that ( ( ( ( 's ( great news ) ) , ) ( because ( ( , ( ( it ( turns out ) ) , ) ) ( we ( 're ( very ( good ( at ( ( collective action ) ( with ( digital technology ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( there ( ( 's ( ( a ( ( very large ) community ) ) ( of ( people ( that ( are ( building ( ( the tools ) ( that ( we ( need ( to ( ( ( do things ) together ) effectively ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( It ( ( ( 's not ) ( just Code ) ) ( for ( America fellows ) ) ) ) ( , ( there ( ( are ( ( ( hundreds ( of people ) ) ( all ( over ( the country ) ) ) ) ( that ( are ( ( standing and ) ( ( ( writing ( civic apps ) ) ( every day ) ) ( in ( their ( own communities ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( They ( ( ( have n't ) ( ( given up ) ( on government ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( They ( are ( frustrated ( as ( hell ( with it ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( they ( ( 're not ) ( complaining ( about it ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( 're ( fixing it ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( these folks ) ( ( know ( something ( that ( we ( 've ( lost ( sight of ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( that ( ( ( 's ( that ( when ( ( ( you ( ( strip away ) ( ( all ( your feelings ) ) ( about politics ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the line ) ( at ( the DMV ) ) ) and ) ( ( all ( those ( other things ) ) ) ( that ( we ( 're ( really ( mad about ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) government ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( is , ) ( at ( its core ) ) ) , ) ( in ( ( the words ) ( of ( Tim O'Reilly ) ) ) ) ) , ) `` ) ( What ( we ( ( do together ) ( that ( we ( ( ca n't ) ( do alone ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) )
( Now ( ( ( a lot ) ( of people ) ) ( ( have ( ( given up ) ( on government ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( ( if ( you ( 're ( one ( of ( those people ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( would ( ( ( ask ( that ( you reconsider ) ) ) , ) ( because ( things ( are changing ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Politics ( ( is not ) changing ) ) ; ) ( government ( is changing ) ) ) . )
( -- ( ( how ( we ( think ( about it ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( going ( to ( effect ( how ( ( that change ) happens ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( I ( ( ( did n't ) ( ( know ( very much ) ) ( about ( government ( when ( I ( started ( this program ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( like ( ( a lot ) ( of people ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( thought ( government ( ( was basically ) ( about ( getting ( people ( elected ( to office ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( Well ( ( after ( two years ) ) ( , ( I ( ( 've ( come ( to ( the ( conclusion ( ( that , ) ( ( especially ( local government ) ) ( , ( is ( about opossums ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( the ( call center ) ) ( for ( the ( services ( and ( information line ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( 's generally ) ( where ( you ( will ( get ( if ( you ( call ( 311 ( in ( your city ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( you ( ( should ever ) ( ( ( have ( the ( chance ( to ( staff ( ( your ( city 's ) ) ( call center ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( as ( ( our ( fellow ( Scott Silverman ) ) ) ( ( did ( as ( part ( of ( the program ) ) ) ) ) ( -- ( ( in fact ) ( , ( they ( all ( ( ( do that ) -- ) ( you ( will ( find ( that ( people ( call ( government ( with ( ( ( ( a ( ( very wide ) range ) ) ( of issues ) ) , ) ( including ( having ( ( an opossum ) ( ( stuck in ) ( your house ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( Scott ( ( gets ( this call ) ) . ) ) )
( ( He ( ( types ( `` ( Opossum '' ) ) ) ( into ( this ( official ( knowledge base ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( And finally ) ( , ( ( he says ) , ) ) ) ( `` ( Look ( , ( ( ( ( can you ) ( ( ( just ( ( open ( all ( the doors ) ) ) ( to ( your house ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( play music ) really ) ( ( loud and ) ( see ( if ( ( the thing ) leaves ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) '' ) ) ) ) )
( But ( that ( ( ( was n't ) ( ( the end ) ( of ( the opossums ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Boston ( ( ( ( does n't ) just ) ( have ( a ( call center ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( has ( ( ( ( ( an app ) , ) ( ( ( a Web ) and ) ( mobile app ) ) ) , ) ( called ( Citizens Connect ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( we ( ( ( did n't ) ( write ( this app ) ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( ( the work ) ( of ( the ( ( very smart ) people ) ) ) ) ( at ( ( ( the Office ) ( of ( New ( Urban Mechanics ) ) ) ) ( in Boston ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( what ( ( happens ( with Citizens ) ) Connect ) ) ( ( is different ) . ) ) )
( So ( Scott ( ( was ( speaking person-to-person ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( But ( ( on Citizens ) ( Connect ( everything ( is public ) ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( everybody ( can ( see this ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( in ( this case ) ) ( , ( ( a neighbor ) ( ( saw it ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( Pretty simple ) . )
( And ( it ( ( ( 's also ) ( ( a ( great example ) ) ( of ( government ( ( getting in ) ( on ( the ( crowd-sourcing game ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( it ( ( ( 's also ) ( ( ( a ( great example ) ) ( of government ) ) ( as ( a platform ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( ( do n't ) ( ( mean necessarily ) ( ( ( a ( technological definition ) ) ( of platform ) ) here ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( ( 'm just ) ( talking ( about ( ( a platform ) ( for ( people ( ( ( to ( help themselves ) ) and ) ( to ( help others ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( ( ( ( ( one citizen ) ( helped ( another citizen ) ) ) , ) but ) ( government ( ( played ( a ( key role ) ) ) here ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( connected ( those ( two people ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( it ( ( ( ( ( could ( have ( ( ( connected them ) ( with ( government services ) ) ) ( if ( they ( 'd ( been needed ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ( a neighbor ) ( is ( a ( ( ( far better ) and ) ( ( cheaper alternative ) ( to ( government services ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( When ( ( one neighbor ) ( helps another ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( strengthen ( our communities ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( call ( ( animal control ) ( , ( it ( just ( costs ( ( a lot ) ( of money ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( ( one ( of ( ( the ( important things ) ) ( we ( need ( to ( think ( about government ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( it ( ( ( 's not ) ( the ( same thing ) ) ) ( as politics ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( most people ) ( ( get ( ( ( that , ) but ) ( they ( think ( that ( one ( is ( ( the input ) ( to ( the other ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( That ( our input ) ) ( to ( ( the system ) ( of government ) ) ) ) ( ( is voting ) . ) )
( Now ( ( ( ( how many ) times ) ( ( have we ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( elected ( a ( political leader ) ) ) -- ) and ) sometimes ) ( we ( spend ( ( a lot ) ( of ( energy ( getting ( ( a ( new ( political leader ) ) ) elected ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) and ) ( then ( we ( sit back ) ) ) ) and ) ( we ( expect ( government ( to ( reflect ( ( ( our values ) and ) ( meet ( our needs ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( then ( not ( that ( ( much changes ) ? ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( That ( 's ( because ( government ( is ( like ( a ( vast ( ( ocean and ) politics ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( the ( six-inch layer ) ) ( on top ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( what ( 's ( under that ) ) ) ( ( is ( what ( we ( call bureaucracy ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( we ( ( say ( that ( word ( with ( such contempt ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( it ( ( 's ( that ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( contempt ( that ( ( keeps ( this thing ) ) ( that ( we own ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( we ( ( pay for ) ( as ( something ( that ( 's ( working ( against us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( this ( other thing ) ) ) , ) and ) ( then ( we ( 're ( disempowering ourselves ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( People ( ( seem ( to ( think ( politics ( is sexy ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( we ( want ( ( this institution ) ( to ( work ( for us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( 're ( going ( to ( have ( to ( make ( bureaucracy sexy ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Because ( that ( 's ( where ( ( ( the ( real work ) ) ( of government ) ) happens ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( have ( to ( engage ( with ( ( the machinery ) ( of government ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( that ( 's ( ( OccupytheSEC movement ) ( ( has done ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( Have you ) ( seen ( these guys ) ) ) ? )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a group ) ( of ( ( concerned citizens ) ( that ( have ( written ( ( a ( ( very detailed ) ( 325-page report ) ) ) ( that ( 's ( ( a response ) ( to ( ( ( the ( SEC 's ) ) request ) ( for ( comment ( on ( the ( Financial ( Reform Bill ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( That ( ( 's not ) ( being ( politically active ) ) ) ) ( , ( that ( ( 's ( being ( bureaucratically active ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Now ( for ( those ( of ( us ( who ( 've ( ( given up ) ( on government ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( 's ( time ( that ( we ( ( asked ( ourselves ( about ( the world ) ) ) ) ( that ( we ( want ( to ( leave ( for ( our children ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( You ( ( have ( to ( see ( ( the ( enormous challenges ) ) ( that ( they ( 're ( going ( to face ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Do we ) really ) ( think ( we ( 're ( going ( to ( get ( where ( we ( ( need ( to go ) ) ( without ( fixing ( ( the ( one institution ) ) ( that ( can ( act ( on ( behalf ( of ( all ( of us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( ( ( ( We ( ( ca n't ) ( do ( without government ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( we ( do ( ( need it ) ( to ( be ( more effective ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( The ( good news ) ) ( ( is ( that ( technology ( is ( making ( it ( possible ( to ( fundamentally ( reframe ( ( ( the function ) ( of government ) ) ( in ( ( a way ) ( that ( ( can actually ) ( scale ( by ( strengthening ( civil society ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( ( ( there ( 's ( ( ( a generation ) ( out there ) ) ( that ( 's ( ( grown up ) ( on ( the Internet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they ( know ( that ( it ( ( 's not ) ( that ( ( hard ( to ( ( do things ) together ) ) ) ( , ( you ( just ( have ( to ( ( architect ( the systems ) ) ( the ( right way ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the ( average age ) ) ( of ( our fellows ) ) ) ( is 28 ) ) , ) so ) ( I ( ( ( ( am , ) begrudgingly ) , ) ( ( ( almost ( a generation ) ) older ) ( than ( most ( of them ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( a generation ) ( that ( 's ( ( grown up ) ( ( ( taking ( their voices ) ) ( pretty much ) ) ( for granted ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( ( 're not ) ( fighting ( that ( ( ( battle ( that ( we ( ( 're all ) ( fighting ( about ( who ( gets ( to speak ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( ( they all ) ( get ( to speak ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( They ( can ( ( express ( ( their opinion ) ( on ( any channel ) ) ) ) ( at ( any time ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they do ) ) . )
( ( So ( when ( they ( 're ( faced ( with ( ( the problem ) ( of government ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( ( do n't ) ( care ( ( as much ) ( about ( using ( their voices ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( They ( ( 're ( using ( their hands ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( 're ( ( using ( their hands ) ) ( to ( write ( applications ( that ( ( make ( government work ) ) better ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( those applications ) ( ( let ( us ( ( use ( our hands ) ) ( to ( make ( ( our communities ) better ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( That ( ( could ( be ( ( ( ( shoveling out ) ( a hydrant ) ) , ) ( ( ( pulling ( a weed ) ) , ) ( ( turning over ) ( ( a garbage ) ( can ( with ( ( an opossum ) ( in it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( ( ( certainly ( , ( we ( could ( have ( been ( ( shoveling out ) ( ( those ( fire hydrants ) ) ( all along ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( many people ) do ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( ( ( ( ( these apps ) ( ( are ( like ( little ( digital reminders ) ) ) ) ( that ( we ( ( 're not ) ( just consumers ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( we ( ( 're not ) ( just ( ( ( consumers ( of government ) ) , ) ( ( ( putting ( in ( our taxes ) ) ) and ) ( getting ( back services ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( We ( 're ( more ( than that ) ) ) ) , ) ( we ( 're citizens ) ) ) . )
( And ( we ( ( ( 're not ) ( going ( to ( ( fix government ) ( until ( we ( fix citizenship ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( ( ( ( ( This ( may ( sound strange ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( 'm ( ( a ( big fan ) ) ( of ( the ( concrete block ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Very ( ( quickly ( concrete blocks ) ) ( ( became ( ( the ( most-used ( construction unit ) ) ) ( in ( the world ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( They ( ( enabled ( us ( to ( ( ( to ( build ( things ( that ( were ( larger ( than us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( ( buildings , ) bridges ) , ) ( ( one brick ) ( at ( a time ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( Essentially concrete ) blocks ) ( ( had ( become ( ( the ( building block ) ) ( of ( our time ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Almost ( a ( hundred years ) ) ) later ) ( in 1947 ) ) ( , ( LEGO ( ( ( came up ) ( with this ) ) . ) ) ) )
( It ( ( was ( called ( the ( Automatic ( Binding Brick ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( in ( a ( few ( short years ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( LEGO bricks ) ( ( ( took place ) ( in ( every household ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( estimated ( that ( ( ( ( ( ( ( over 400 ) billion ) bricks ) ( have ( been produced ) ) ) -- ) or ) ( ( 75 bricks ) ( for ( ( every person ) ( on ( the planet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( You ( ( ( do n't ) ( have ( to ( be ( ( an engineer ) ( to ( make ( ( ( ( ( beautiful houses ) , ) ( beautiful bridges ) ) , ) ( beautiful buildings ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( LEGO ( ( made ( it accessible ) ) . ) )
( ( LEGO ( ( has essentially ) ( taken ( the ( concrete block ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( the ( building block ) ) ( of ( the world ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( made it ) ( into ( ( the ( building block ) ) ( of ( our imagination ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Meanwhile ( ( ( the ( exact ( same year ) ) ) ( , ( ( at ( Bell Labs ) ) ( ( the ( next revolution ) ) ( was ( about ( to ( be announced ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the ( next ( building block ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( The transistor ) ( ( was ( ( ( a ( small ( plastic unit ) ) ) ( that ( would ( ( take us ) ( from ( ( a world ) ( of ( static bricks ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( piled ( on ( top ( of ( each other ) ) ) ) ) ( to ( ( a world ) ( where ( everything ( was interactive ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Like ( the ( concrete block ) ) ) ( , ( ( the transistor ) ( allows ( you ( to ( build ( much larger ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( more complex ) circuits ) , ) ( ( one brick ) ( at ( a time ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( I personally ) ( ( do n't ) ( accept this ) ) ) , ) ( that ( ( ( the ( building block ) ) ( of ( our time ) ) ) ( is ( reserved ( for experts ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( I ( decided ( to ( change that ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( Eight years ) ago ) ( ( when ( I ( was ( at ( the ( Media Lab ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( started ( exploring ( ( this idea ) ( of ( how ( to ( ( put ( ( the power ) ( of engineers ) ) ) ( in ( ( the hands ) ( of ( ( artists and ) designers ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( A ( few years ) ) ago ) ( I ( ( started ( developing littleBits ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Let ( me ( ( show you ) ( how ( they work ) ) ) ) ) . )
( LittleBits ( ( are ( ( electronic modules ) ( with ( each ( one ( specific function ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( 're ( pre-engineered ( to ( be ( ( light , ) ( sound ( , ( ( motors and ) sensors ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( the ( best part ) ) ( about it ) ) ( ( is ( they ( ( snap together ) ( with magnets ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( you ( ( ( ca n't ) ( ( put them ) ( the ( wrong way ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The bricks ) ( ( are color-coded ) . ) )
( Green ( ( ( ( is ( ( ( output , ) blue ) ( is power ) ) ) , ) ( pink ( is ( ( ( input and ) orange ) ( is wire ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( all ( ( you ( need ( to do ) ) ) ( is ( ( snap ( a blue ) ) ( to ( a ( ( green and ) ( ( very quickly ) ( you ( can ( start ( making ( larger circuits ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( You ( ( put ( a blue ) ) ( to ( a green ) ) ) ) , ) ( you ( can ( make light ) ) ) ) . )
( You ( ( can ( ( ( ( put ( a knob ) ) ( in between ) ) and ) ( now ( you ( 've ( made ( a ( little dimmer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( Switch out ) ( ( the knob ) ( for ( ( ( ( a ( pulse module ) ) , ) ( which ( is here ) ) ) , ) ) ) ) and ) ( now ( you ( 've ( made ( a ( little blinker ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( Add ( this buzzer ) ) ( for ( some ( extra punch ) ) ) ) and ) ( you ( 've ( created ( a ( noise machine ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( I ( ( 'm ( going ( to ( stop that ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( beyond ( simple play ) ) ) ( , ( littleBits ( ( ( are actually ) ( pretty powerful ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Instead ( of ( having ( to program ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( to wire ) ( , ( ( to solder ) ( , ( littleBits ( ( ( allow ( you ( to program ) ) ) ( using ( ( very simple ) ( intuitive gestures ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( So ( ( to ( ( make ( this blink ) ) ( ( faster or ) slower ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( ( would just ) ( ( ( turn ( this knob ) ) and ) ( basically ( make ( it ( pulse ( ( faster or ) slower ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( The idea ) ( behind littleBits ) ) ( ( is ( that ( it ( 's ( a ( growing library ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( want ( to ( make ( ( ( every ( single interaction ) ) ( in ( the world ) ) ) ( into ( a ( ready-to-use brick ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Lights ( , ( ( ( sounds , ) ( ( ( ( ( solar panels ) , ) motors ) -- ) ( everything ( should ( be accessible ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( We ( ( ( ( 've ( been ( ( giving littleBits ) ( to kids ) ) ) ) and ) ( seeing ( them ( play ( with them ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( it ( ( 's ( been ( an ( incredible experience ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The ( nicest thing ) ) ( ( is ( how ( they ( start ( to ( understand ( ( ( the electronics ) ( around them ) ) ( ( from everyday ) ( that ( they ( ( do n't ) ( learn ( at schools ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( For example ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( how ( ( a nightlight ) works ) ) , ) or ) ( why ( ( an ( elevator door ) ) ( stays ( open ( , ( or ( how ( ( an iPod ) ( responds ( to touch ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( We ( ( ( 've also ) ( been ( ( taking littleBits ) ( to ( design schools ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( for example ) ) ( , ( we ( ( 've ( had ( designers ( with ( ( no experience ) ( with ( electronics ( whatsoever ( start ( to ( play ( with ( littleBits ( as ( a material ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Here ( you ( ( see , ) ( with ( ( ( felt and ) paper ) ( water bottles ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( have ( Geordie making ) ) ... ) ) ) )
( ( ( A ( few weeks ) ) ago ) ( we ( ( ( ( ( ( took littleBits ) ( to RISD ) ) and ) ( ( ( gave them ) ( to ( some designers ) ) ) ( with ( ( no experience ) ( in ( ( ( engineering whatsoever ) -- ) ( ( ( ( just ( cardboard ( , ( ( wood and ) paper ) ) ) ) -- ) and ) ( ( ( told them ) `` ) ( Make something ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) )
( Here ( ( 's ( ( an example ) ( of ( ( ( ( a project ) ( they made ) ) , ) ( a ( motion-activated ( confetti ( canon ball ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( ( wait , ) ( this ( ( is actually ) ( my ( favorite project ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( ( a lobster ) ( made ( of playdough ) ) ) ( that ( 's ( afraid ( of ( the dark ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( To ( these non-engineers ) ) ( , ( littleBits ( ( became ( ( ( ( another material ) , ) electronics ) ( became ( just ( another material ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( we ( ( want ( to ( make ( ( this material ) ( accessible ( to everyone ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( littleBits ( ( is open-source ) . ) ) )
( You ( ( ( ( ( ( can ( go ( on ( the website ) ) ) ) , ) ( download ( all ( the ( design files ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( make ( them yourself ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( want ( to ( ( ( encourage ( ( a world ) ( of creators ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( of inventors ) ( , ( ( of contributors ) , ) ) ) ( ( because ( ( this world ) ( that ( we ( live in ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( this ( interactive world ) ) ( , ( is ours ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( go ( ( ahead and ) ( start inventing ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( I ( ( ( 'm here ) ( to ( share ( my photography ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Or ( ( ( is it ) photography ) ? ) )
( Because ( , ( ( of course ) ( , ( this ( ( is ( ( a photograph ) ( that ( you ( ( ca n't ) ( take ( with ( your camera ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( Yet ( , ( ( ( my interest ) ( in photography ) ) ( ( started ( as ( I ( ( got ( my ( first ( digital camera ) ) ) ) ( at ( ( the age ) ( of 15 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( It ( mixed ( with ( ( my ( earlier passion ) ) ( for drawing ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( it ( was ( a ( ( ( ( ( bit different ) , ) ( because ( using ( the camera ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( the process ) ( was ( in ( ( the planning ) instead ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( when ( you ( ( take ( a photograph ) ) ( with ( a camera ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the process ) ( ( ends ( when ( you ( press ( the trigger ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( ( to me ) ( it ( felt ( ( like ( photography ( was ( more ( ( about ( ( being ( at ( the ( right place ) ) ) ) and ) ) ( the ( right time ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( I ( ( felt ( like ( anyone ( could ( do that ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( ( I ( wanted ( to ( create ( something different ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( something ( where ( ( the process ) ( starts ( when ( you ( press ( the trigger ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( But ( it ( ( has ( an ( unexpected twist ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( despite that ) ( , ( it ( ( retains ( ( a level ) ( of realism ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( Or ( ( photos ( like ( these ( -- ( ( ( ( both ( ( dark and ) colorful ) ) , ) but ) ( all ( with ( ( a ( common goal ) ) ( of ( retaining ( ( the level ) ( of realism ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( When ( I ( say ( realism ( , ( I ( mean photo-realism ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Because ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( of course ) ( , ( it ( ( 's not ) ( something ( you ( can ( capture really ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( always ( want ( it ( to ( look ( like ( it ( could ( have ( been ( ( captured somehow ) ( as ( a photograph ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Photos ( where ( you ( will ( ( need ( a ( brief moment ) ) ) ( to ( think ( to ( ( figure out ) ( the trick ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( it ( ( 's ( ( more about ) ( ( capturing ( ( an idea ) ( than ( about ( capturing ( a moment ) ) ) ) ) ) really ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( what ( ( ( 's ( the trick ) ) ( that ( makes ( it ( look realistic ) ) ) ) ) ? ) ) )
( ( ( Is it ) ( something ( about ( ( ( the details ) or ) ( the colors ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( ( Is it ) ( something ( about ( the light ) ) ) ) ? )
( What ( ( creates ( the illusion ) ) ? ) )
( Sometimes ( ( the perspective ) ( ( is ( the illusion ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( in ( the end ) ) ( , ( it ( ( comes ( down ( to ( ( ( how ( we ( interpret ( the world ) ) ) ) and ) ( how ( it ( can ( be ( realized ( on ( a ( two-dimensional surface ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( It ( ( ( 's not ) really ) ( what ( is realistic ) ) ) ) , ) ( it ( 's ( what ( we ( think ( ( looks realistic ) really ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( I ( ( think ( ( the basics ) ( are ( quite simple ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( just ( ( ( see it ) ( as ( ( ( a puzzle ) ( of reality ) ) ( ( ( where ( you ( can ( take ( ( different pieces ) ( of reality ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( ( put it ) together ) ( to ( create ( alternate reality ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( let ( me ( ( show you ) ( a ( simple example ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Here ( we ( ( have ( ( ( three ( ( perfectly imaginable ) ( physical objects ) ) ) , ) ( something ( ( we all ) ( can ( relate ( to ( living ( in ( a ( three-dimensional world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( combined ( in ( a ( certain way ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( can ( create ( something ( that ( still ( ( ( looks three-dimensional ) , ) ( like ( it ( could exist ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( But ( ( at ( the ( same time ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( know ( it ( ca n't ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( we ( ( ( ( trick ( our brains ) ) , ) ( because ( ( our brain ) ( simply ( ( does n't ) ( accept ( the ( fact ( that ( it ( ( ( does n't ) really ) ( make sense ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( ( see ( the ( same process ) ) ) ( with ( combining photographs ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( ( ( 's just ) really ) ( about ( combining ( different realities ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( ( ( the things ) ( that ( make ( ( a ( photograph look ) ) realistic ) ) ) ) ( ( , ( ( I ( think ( it ( 's ( ( the things ) ( that ( we ( ( ( do n't ) even ) ( think about ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ) ( ( ( the things ) all ) ( around ( us ( in ( our ( daily lives ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( when ( combining photographs ) ) ( , ( this ( ( ( ( is ( really ( important ( to consider ) ) ) ) , ) ( because ( otherwise ( it ( just ( ( looks wrong ) somehow ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( I ( ( would ( like ( to ( say ( that ( there ( are ( ( three ( simple rules ) ) ( to ( follow ( to ( achieve ( a ( realistic result ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( As ( you ( can see ) ) ) ( , ( ( these images ) ( ( ( are n't ) ( really special ) ) . ) ) ) )
( But ( combined ( , ( they ( ( can ( create ( something ( like this ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( ( the ( first rule ) ) ( ( is ( that ( photos ( combined ( should ( have ( the ( same perspective ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Secondly ( , ( photos ( ( combined ( should ( have ( ( the ( same type ) ) ( of light ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( ( ( these ( two images ) ) both ) ( ( fulfill ( these ( two requirements ) ) ) ( -- ( shot ( ( ( at ( the ( same height ) ) ) and ) ( in ( ( the ( same type ) ) ( of light ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( The ( third one ) ) ( ( is ( about ( making ( it ( impossible ( to ( distinguish ( where ( ( the ( different images ) ) ( ( begin and ) ( end ( by ( making ( it seamless ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Make ( it ( impossible ( to ( say ( how ( ( the image ) ( actually ( was composed ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( So ( by ( ( matching color ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( contrast and ) brightness ) ( in ( ( the borders ) ( between ( the ( different images ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( adding ( ( photographic defects ) ( like ( depth ( of field ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( desaturated colors ) ) and ) noise ) ( , ( we ( erase ( ( the borders ) ( between ( ( ( the ( different images ) ) and ) ( make ( it ( ( ( look ( like ( one ( single image ) ) ) ) , ) ( despite ( the ( fact ( that ( ( one image ) ( can ( ( contain ( hundreds ( of layers ) ) ) basically ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( ( ( here 's ) ( another example ) ) . ) )
( ( One ( might ( think ( that ( this ( is ( ( just ( an image ) ) ( of ( ( ( a landscape ) and ) ( the ( lower part ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( what ( 's manipulated ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( this image ) ( ( ( is actually ) ( entirely ( composed ( of ( photographs ( from ( different locations ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( I personally ) ( ( think ( that ( it ( ( 's easier ) ( ( to actually ) ( ( ( create ( ( a place ) ( than ( to ( find ( a place ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( because ( then ( you ( ( do n't ) ( need ( to ( compromise ( with ( ( the ideas ) ( in ( your head ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( it ( ( does ( require ( ( a lot ) ( of planning ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( ( getting ( this idea ) ) ( during winter ) ) ( , ( I ( ( knew ( that ( I ( had ( ( several months ) ( ( ( to ( plan it ) ) , ) ( to ( ( find ( ( the ( different locations ) ) ( for ( ( the pieces ) ( of ( the puzzle ) ) ) ) ) ) basically ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( ( for example ) ( , ( ( the fish ) ( ( was ( captured ( on ( a ( fishing trip ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( The shores ) ( ( are ( from ( a ( different location ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( The ( underwater part ) ) ( ( was ( captured ( in ( a ( stone pit ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( yeah ( , ( I ( even ( ( ( ( turned ( the house ) ) ( on ( top ( of ( the ( island red ) ) ) ) ) ) ( to ( make ( it ( look ( more Swedish ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( So ( ( to ( achieve ( a ( realistic result ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( think ( it ( comes ( down ( to planning ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( It ( always ( ( starts ( with ( ( ( a sketch ) , ) ( an idea ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Then ( it ( ( 's ( about ( combining ( the ( different photographs ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( here ( ( every piece ) ( ( ( is ( very well ) ) planned ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( ( if ( you ( do ( ( a ( good job ) ) ( capturing ( the photos ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the result ) ( ( ( ( can ( be ( quite beautiful ) ) ) and ) also ) ( quite realistic ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( ( ( ( ( all ( the tools ) ) ( are ( out there ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( the ( only thing ) ) ( that ( limits us ) ) ) ( is ( our imagination ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( ( In ( the 1980s ) ) ( ( in ( the communist ) ) ( ( Eastern Germany ) ( , ( ( if ( you ( owned ( a typewriter ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( had ( to ( ( register it ) ( with ( the government ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( You ( ( had ( to ( ( register ( ( a ( sample sheet ) ) ( of text ) ) ) ( out ( of ( the typewriter ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( this ( ( was ( done ( so ( ( the government ) ( could ( track ( where ( text ( was ( coming from ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( If ( they ( found ( ( a paper ) ( which ( had ( ( the ( wrong kind ) ) ( of thought ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( could ( ( track down ) ( who ( created ( that thought ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( we ( in ( the West ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( could n't ) ( understand ( how ( anybody ( could ( do this ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( how much ) ( this ( would ( restrict ( freedom ( of speech ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( This ( ( is ( ( happening ( to us ) ) today ) ) . ) )
( And ( nobody ( ( seems ( to ( be ( making ( ( a fuss ) ( about it ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( If ( we ( ( take ( a look ) ) ( at ( what ( ( 's really ) ( happening ( in ( the ( online world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( can ( group ( ( the attacks ) ( based ( on ( the attackers ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( have ( three ( main groups ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( have ( online criminals ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( the motives ) ( of ( online criminals ) ) ) ( ( are ( very ( easy ( to understand ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( These guys ) ( ( make money ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( They ( ( use ( online attacks ) ) ( to ( make ( lots ( of money ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( lots and ) lots ) ( of it ) ) ) . )
( We ( actually ( ( have ( ( ( ( ( ( several cases ) ( of ( millionaires online ) ) ) , ) multimillionaires ) , ) ( who ( ( made money ) ( with ( their attacks ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( Here 's ) ( Vladimir ( Tsastsin ( form Tartu ) ) ) ) ( in Estonia ) ) . )
( This ( ( is ( Alfred Gonzalez ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( Stephen Watt ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( Bjorn Sundin ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( ( Matthew Anderson ) , ) ( ( ( Tariq Al-Daour ) and ) ( so ( ( ( on and ) so ) on ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( These guys ) ( make ( ( their fortunes ) online ) ) ) , ) but ) ( they ( ( make it ) ( through ( ( the ( illegal means ) ) ( of ( using ( things ( like ( ( banking trojans ) ( to ( ( ( steal money ) ( from ( our ( bank accounts ) ) ) ) ( while ( we ( do ( ( ( ( ( online banking ) , ) or ) ( with keyloggers ) ) ( to ( ( collect ( our ( credit ( card information ) ) ) ) ( while ( we ( are ( ( doing ( online shopping ) ) ( from ( an ( infected computer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( I ( ( claim ( it ( ( ( 's already ) today ) ( that ( it ( ( ( ( 's ( more likely ) ) ( for ( any ( of us ) ) ) ) ( to ( become ( ( the victim ) ( of ( a ( crime online ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( than ( here ( in ( the ( real world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( it ( ( ( 's ( very obvious ) ) ( that ( this ( ( is only ) ( going ( to ( get worse ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( In ( the future ) ) ( , ( ( ( the majority ) ( of crime ) ) ( ( will ( be ( happening online ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( The ( second ( major group ) ) ) ( of attackers ) ) ( that ( we ( are ( watching today ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( are not ) ( motivated ( by money ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( 're ( motivated ( by ( ( ( something else ) -- ) ( motivated ( by ( ( protests , ) ( motivated ( by ( ( ( an opinion ) , ) ( motivated ( by ( the laughs ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Groups ( like Anonymous ) ) ( ( ( ( have ( ( risen up ) ( over ( the ( last ( 12 months ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( have ( become ( ( a ( major player ) ) ( in ( ( the field ) ( of ( online attacks ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( then ( we ( ( look ( at ( cases ( like ( what ( happened ( in DigiNotar ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( a ( prime example ) ) ( of ( what ( happens ( when ( governments ( attack ( against ( their ( own citizens ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( DigiNotar ( ( is ( ( ( ( a ( Certificate Authority ) ) ( from ( The Netherlands ) ) ) ( -- ( or ( actually , ) ) ) ) ( it was ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( was ( ( ( running ( into bankruptcy ) ) ( last fall ) ) ( because ( they ( were ( hacked into ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Somebody ( broke in ) ) and ) ( they ( ( hacked it ) thoroughly ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( I ( ( asked ( last week ) ) ( in ( ( a meeting ) ( with ( Dutch ( government representatives ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( I ( ( ( asked ( one ( of ( ( the leaders ) ( of ( the team ) ) ) ) ) ) ( whether ( he ( found ( plausible ( that ( people ( died ( because ( of ( the ( DigiNotar hack ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( ( his answer ) ( ( was yes ) . ) ) )
( So ( how ( ( ( do people ) ( die ( as ( ( the result ) ( of ( ( a hack ) ( like this ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) ) )
( Well ( DigiNotar ( is ( a C.A. ) ) ) )
( They ( ( sell certificates ) . ) )
( What ( ( ( do you ) ( do ( with certificates ) ) ) ? ) )
( Well ( you ( ( ( need ( a certificate ) ) ( if ( you ( have ( ( a website ) ( that ( has ( ( ( ( https , ) ( SSL ( encrypted services ) ) ) , ) ( services ( like Gmail ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( we all ) , ) or ) ( ( a ( big part ) ) ( of us ) ) ) , ) ( use ( ( Gmail or ) ( one ( of ( their competitors ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( ( these services ) ( ( ( are ( especially popular ) ) ( in ( ( totalitarian states ) ( like ( ( Iran , ) ( where ( dissidents ( ( use ( foreign services ) ) ( like Gmail ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( because ( ( ( they ( know ( they ( are ( ( more trustworthy ) ( than ( the ( local services ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( they ( are ( encrypted ( over ( SSL connections ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( ( the ( local government ) ) ( ( ca n't ) ( snoop ( on ( their discussions ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Except ( they ( can ( if ( they ( hack ( into ( a ( foreign C.A. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( and ( issue ( rogue certificates ) ) ) . )
( And ( this ( ( ( is exactly ) ( what ( happened ( with ( ( the case ) ( of DigiNotar ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( What ( ( about ( ( Arab ( ( Spring and ) things ) ) ( that ( have ( been ( ( ( ( happening , ) ( for example ) ) , ) ( in Egypt ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( Well ( in Egypt ) ) ( , ( ( the rioters ) ( ( ( ( ( ( looted ( ( the headquarters ) ( of ( the ( Egyptian ( secret police ) ) ) ) ) ) ( in ( April 2011 ) ) ) , ) and ) ( when ( they ( were ( looting ( ( the building ) ( they ( found ( lots ( of papers ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Among ( those papers ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( was ( this binder ) ) ( entitled ( `` FINFISHER ) ) ) . ) '' ) ) )
( And ( ( within ( that binder ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( were notes ) ( from ( a company ) ) ) ( based ( in Germany ) ) ) ( which ( had ( ( ( sold ( the ( Egyptian government ) ) ) ( ( ( a set ) ( of tools ) ) ( for intercepting ) ) ) ( -- ( and ( ( in ( ( very large ) scale ) ) -- ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( all ( the communication ) ) ( of ( ( the citizens ) ( of ( the country ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( They ( ( had ( ( sold ( this tool ) ) ( for ( ( 280,000 Euros ) ( to ( the ( Egyptian government ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( The ( company headquarters ) ) ( ( are ( right here ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( Western governments ) ( ( are ( ( providing ( totalitarian governments ) ) ( with ( tools ( to ( ( do this ) ( against ( their ( own citizens ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( ( Western governments ) ( ( ( are ( ( doing it ) ( to themselves ) ) ) ( as well ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( For example ) ( , ( ( in Germany ) ( , ( ( ( just ( a couple ) ) ( of weeks ) ) ( ( ( ago ( ( the ( so-called ( State Trojan ) ) ) ( was found ) ) ) , ) ( which ( was ( ( a trojan ) ( ( used ( by ( German ( government officials ) ) ) ) ( to ( investigate ( their ( own citizens ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( If ( you ( are ( ( a suspect ) ( in ( a ( criminal case ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( well ( it ( 's ( pretty obvious ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( your phone ) ( ( will ( be tapped ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( But ( today ( , ( it ( ( goes ( beyond that ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( They ( ( will ( tap ( your ( Internet connection ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( ( will even ) ( ( use ( tools ( like ( State Trojan ) ) ) ) ( to ( ( infect ( your computer ) ) ( with ( ( ( a trojan ) , ) ( which ( ( ( ( ( enables ( them ( to ( watch ( all ( your communication ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( to ( listen ( to ( your ( online discussions ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( to ( collect ( your passwords ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Why ( ( ( should I ) worry ) ? ) )
( And ( this ( ( is ( ( ( an argument ) , ) ( which ( ( does n't ) ( make sense ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Privacy ( ( is implied ) . ) )
( Privacy ( ( ( is not ) ( up ( for discussion ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( ( is not ) ( ( a question ) ( between ( privacy ( against security ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a question ) ( of ( freedom ( against control ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( while ( we ( might ( ( trust ( our governments ) ) ( right now ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( right here ) ( in 2011 ) ) ( , ( ( ( any right ) ( we ( give away ) ) ) ( ( will ( be ( ( given away ) ( for good ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( And ( ( do ( we trust ) ) ( , ( ( ( do we ) blindly ) ( ( ( ( trust , ) ( any ( future government ) ) ) , ) ( ( a government ) ( we ( might ( have ( ( 50 years ) ( from now ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( And ( these ( ( are ( the ( questions ( that ( we ( have ( to ( ( worry about ) ( for ( the ( next ( 50 years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
