( ( Last year ) ( I ( ( ( showed ( these ( two slides ) ) ) ( ( so that ) ( demonstrate ( that ( ( ( ( ( the ( arctic ( ice cap ) ) ) , ) ( which ( ( for ( most ( of ( the ( last ( ( three million ) years ) ) ) ) ) ) ( has ( been ( ( the size ) ( of ( the ( lower ( 48 states ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( has ( shrunk ( by ( 40 percent ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( this ( ( ( understates ( ( the seriousness ) ( of ( this ( particular problem ) ) ) ) ) ( because ( it ( ( does n't ) ( show ( ( the thickness ) ( of ( the ice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The ( arctic ( ice cap ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( is , ) ( in ( a sense ) ) ) , ) ( ( the ( beating heart ) ) ( of ( the ( global ( climate system ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( expands ( in ( ( ( winter and ) contracts ) ( in summer ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( The ( next slide ) ) ( I ( ( show ( you ( will ( be ( ( a ( rapid fast-forward ) ) ( of ( what ( 's ( happened ( over ( the ( last ( 25 years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The ( permanent ice ) ) ( ( is ( marked ( in red ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( As ( you see ) ) ( , ( it ( ( expands ( to ( the ( dark blue ) ) ) ) -- ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( that ( 's ( ( the ( annual ice ) ) ( in winter ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( contracts ( in summer ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( The ( so-called ( permanent ice ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( ( five years ) old ) or ) older ) ) , ) ( you ( can see ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( ( almost like ) blood ) , ) ( ( spilling ( out ( of ( the body ) ) ) ) here ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In ( 25 years ) ) ( it ( ( ( ( 's ( gone ( from this ) ) ) , ) ( to this ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( ( is ( a problem ) ) ( because ( ( the warming ) ( ( ( heats up ) ( the ( frozen ground ) ) ) ( around ( ( ( the ( Arctic Ocean ) ) , ) ( where ( there ( is ( ( a ( massive amount ) ) ( of ( ( frozen carbon ) ( ( which , ) ( ( when ( it thaws ) ) ( , ( is ( ( turned ( into methane ) ) ( by microbes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Compared ( to ( ( ( the ( total amount ) ) ( of ( global ( warming pollution ) ) ) ) ( in ( the atmosphere ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( that amount ) ( ( could ( double ( if ( we ( cross ( this ( tipping point ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Already ( ( in ( ( some ( shallow lakes ) ) ( in ( ( Alaska , ) methane ) ) ) ) ( is ( actively ( ( ( bubbling up ) ( out ( of ( the water ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( Professor ( Katey Walter ) ) ( from ( ( the University ) ( of Alaska ) ) ) ) ( ( ( went out ) ( with ( ( another team ) ( to ( ( another ( shallow lake ) ) ( last winter ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( one reason ) ( ( ( is , ) ( ( this ( enormous ( heat sink ) ) ) ( ( ( heats up ) Greenland ) ( from ( the north ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( an ( annual ( melting river ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( the volumes ) ( ( are ( ( much larger ) ( than ever ) ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( ( is ( the ( Kangerlussuaq River ) ) ) ( in ( southwest Greenland ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( you ( want ( to ( know ( how ( ( sea level ) ( ( rises ( from ( land-base ( ice melting ) ) ) ) ( this ( is ( where ( it ( reaches ( the sea ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( These flows ) ( ( are ( increasing ( very rapidly ) ) ) . ) )
( ( At ( ( the ( other end ) ) ( of ( the planet ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( Antarctica ( ( the ( largest mass ) ) ( of ( ice ( on ( the planet ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Last month ) ( scientists ( ( reported ( ( the ( entire continent ) ) ( ( is now ) ( in ( negative ( ice balance ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( west Antarctica ) ( ( ( ( ( ( cropped up ) ( on top ) ) ( some ( under-sea islands ) ) ) , ) ( is ( particularly ( rapid ( in ( its melting ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( That ( ( ( ( 's ( equal ( to ( ( 20 feet ) ( of ( sea level ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( as ( is Greenland ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In ( the Andes ) ) ( , ( ( this glacier ) ( ( is ( ( ( the source ) ( of ( drinking water ) ) ) ( for ( this city ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( The flows ) ( ( have increased ) . ) )
( But ( ( when ( they ( go away ) ) ) ( , ( so ( ( does ( much ( of ( the ( drinking water ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( In California ) ( there ( ( has ( been ( ( a ( 40 ( percent decline ) ) ) ( in ( the ( Sierra snowpack ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( hitting ( the reservoirs ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( the predictions ) ( , ( ( as ( you ( 've read ) ) ) ( , ( ( are serious ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( This ( drying ( around ( the world ) ) ) ) ( ( has ( lead ( to ( ( a ( dramatic increase ) ) ( in fires ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( the disasters ) ( around ( the world ) ) ) ( ( have ( been ( increasing ( at ( an ( ( ( ( absolutely extraordinary ) and ) unprecedented ) rate ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Four times ) ( as ( many ( in ( ( the ( last ( 30 years ) ) ) ( as ( in ( the ( previous 75 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( This ( ( is ( a ( ( completely unsustainable ) pattern ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( you ( look ( at ( in ( the ( context ( of history ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( you ( ( can ( see ( what ( this ( is doing ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( In ( the ( last ( five years ) ) ) ) ( we ( ( 've ( ( added ( ( ( 70 million ) tons ) ( of CO2 ) ) ) ( ( ( every ( 24 hours ) ) -- ) ( ( ( ( 25 million ) tons ) ( every day ) ) ( to ( the oceans ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( Look carefully ) ( at ( ( the area ) ( of ( the ( eastern Pacific ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( from ( the Americas ) ) ( , ( extending westward ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( on ( ( either side ) ( of ( ( ( the ( Indian subcontinent ) ) , ) ( where ( there ( is ( ( a ( radical depletion ) ) ( of ( oxygen ( in ( the oceans ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( The ( biggest ( single cause ) ) ) ( of ( global warming ) ) ) ( , ( ( along ( with ( ( ( deforestation , ) ( which ( is ( ( 20 percent ) ( of it ) ) ) ) ) , ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( the burning ) ( of ( fossil fuels ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( Oil ( is ( a problem ) ) ) , ) and ) ( coal ( is ( the ( ( most serious ) problem ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( The ( United States ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( one ( of ( the ( two ( largest emitters ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( along ( with China ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( the proposal ) ( ( has ( been ( to ( build ( ( ( a lot ) more ) ( coal plants ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( we ( ( 're ( beginning ( to ( see ( a ( sea change ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Here ( ( are ( ( the ones ) ( that ( have ( been ( cancelled ( in ( ( the ( last ( few years ) ) ) ( with ( ( some ( green alternatives ) ) proposed ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( However ( there ( ( is ( ( a ( political battle ) ) ( in ( our country ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( ( ( the ( coal industries ) ) and ) ( the ( oil industries ) ) ) ( ( ( spent ( ( a quarter ) ( of ( ( a billion ) dollars ) ) ) ) ( in ( ( the ( last ( calendar year ) ) ) ( promoting ( ( ( clean coal ) , ) ( which ( is ( an oxymoron ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( That image ) ( ( ( reminded me ) ( of something ) ) . ) )
( ( Around Christmas ) ( , ( ( in ( ( my home ) ( in Tennessee ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( a billion ) gallons ) ( of ( coal sludge ) ) ) ( ( was spilled ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( You ( probably ( ( ( saw it ) ( on ( the news ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( This , ) ( all ( over ( the country ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( is ( ( the ( ( second largest ) ( waste stream ) ) ) ( in America ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( happened ( around Christmas ) ) . ) )
( ( One ( of ( ( ( the ( coal ( industry 's ) ) ) ads ) ( around Christmas ) ) ) ) ( ( was ( this one ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( He ( ( ( 's abundant ) here ) ( in America ) ) ) , ) and ) ( he ( helps ( ( our economy ) grow ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Frosty ( the ( coal man ) ) ) ( ( is ( getting ( cleaner everyday ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( He ( 's ( ( affordable and ) adorable ) ) ) , ) and ) ( workers ( keep ( their pay ) ) ) ) . )
( ( The ( largest ( mountaintop miner ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( the head ) ( of ( Massey Coal ) ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( ( one ( of them ) ) , ) ( part ( of ( one ( of them ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( That ( ( 's ( why ( we ( 've ( made ( it ( our ( primary ( goal ( ( ( to ( ( spend ( ( a ( large sum ) ) ( of money ) ) ) ( on ( an ( advertising ( effort ( to ( help ( bring out ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( complicate ( the truth ) ) ( about coal ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( The fact ) ( ( ( is , ) ( coal ( ( is n't ) dirty ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( We ( think ( it ( 's clean ) ) ) ) -- ) ( ( ( smells good ) , ) too ) ) . )
( So ( ( ( do n't ) ( worry ( about ( climate change ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Leave that ) up ) ( to us ) ) . )
( So ( ( let ( 's ( take ( ( a tour ) ( of ( this ( state-of-the-art ( clean ( coal facility ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( that ( ( 's ( ( the sound ) ( of ( clean ( coal technology ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( while ( burning coal ) ) ( ( is ( one ( of ( ( the ( leading causes ) ) ( of ( ( ( global warming ) , ) ( ( the ( remarkable ( clean ( coal technology ) ) ) ) ( you ( ( see here ) ( changes everything ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( But ( now ( there ( ( is ( ( a ( bold ( new solution ) ) ) ( to ( ( get us ) ( out ( of ( this mess ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( Repower America ) ( with ( 100 ( percent ( clean electricity ) ) ) ) ) ( within ( 10 years ) ) ) . )
( ( A ( plan ( to ( ( put America ) ( back ( to work ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( make ( us ( more secure ) ) ) , ) and ) ( help ( stop ( global warming ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Finally ( , ( ( ( a solution ) ( that ( 's ( ( big enough ) ( to ( solve ( our problems ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( One ( of ( ( the ( fastest ways ) ) ( to ( cut ( ( our dependence ) ( on ( ( old ( dirty fuels ) ) ( that ( are ( killing ( our planet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( ( ( need ( to ( go far ) ) ) , ) quickly ) . ) )
( ( ( Thank you ) ( very much ) ) . )
( ( Last year ) ( ( at TED ) ( I ( ( gave ( ( an introduction ) ( to ( the LHC ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( promised ( to ( ( ( come back ) and ) ( ( give you ) ( ( an update ) ( on ( how ( ( that machine ) worked ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Its job ) ( ( is ( to ( recreate ( ( the conditions ) ( that ( ( ( ( ( were ( ( present less ) ( than ( ( a billionth ) ( of ( a second ) ) ) ) ) ) ( after ( ( the universe ) began ) ) ) , ) ( up ( to ( ( 600 million ) times ) ) ) ) ( a second ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( 's nothing ) ( if ( not ambitious ) ) ) . ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( the machine ) ( below Geneva ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( take ( ( the pictures ) ( of ( ( those ( mini-Big Bangs ) ) ( inside detectors ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( Spectacular picture ) ( here ( of ( ATLAS ( under construction ) ) ) ) ) ( so ( you ( can ( see ( the scale ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( On ( ( the 10th ) ( of September ) ) ) ( ( last year ) ( we ( ( ( turned ( the machine ) ) ( on ( for ( the ( first time ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( this picture ) ( ( was ( taken ( by ATLAS ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( ( caused ( immense celebration ) ) ( in ( the ( control room ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( It ( 's ( ( a picture ) ( of ( ( the ( first ( beam particle ) ) ) ( ( ( going ( ( all ( the way ) ) ( around ( the LHC ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( colliding ( with ( ( a piece ) ( of ( the LHC ) ) ) ) ) deliberately ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( showering particles ) ( into ( the detector ) ) ) ) . )
( ( In ( other words ) ) ( , ( ( when ( we ( saw ( that ( ( picture ( on ( September 10th ) ) ) ( we ( knew ( ( ( ( the machine ) worked ) , ) ( which ( is ( a ( great triumph ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( I ( ( do n't ) ( know ( whether ( this ( ( got ( ( ( ( ( the ( biggest cheer ) ) , ) or ) this ) , ) ) ( when ( someone ( ( ( went ( onto Google ) ) and ) ( saw ( the ( front page ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( was ( like that ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( means ( we ( made ( ( ( cultural impact ) ( as ( well as ) ) ) ( scientific impact ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( About ( a week ) ) later ) ( we ( ( ( ( had ( ( a problem ) ( with ( the machine ) ) ) ) , ) ( related ( actually ( to ( ( ( ( ( these bits ) ( of wire ) ) here ) -- ) ( these ( gold wires ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Those wires ) ( ( ( carry ( ( 13 thousand ) amps ) ) ( when ( ( the machine ) ( is ( working ( in ( full power ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( can ( ( do that ) ( because ( when ( they ( are ( very ( cold ( they ( are ( what ( 's ( called ( superconducting wire ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( at ( minus ( ( ( 271 degrees ) , ) ( colder ( than ( ( the space ) ( between ( the stars ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( those wires ) ( ( can ( take ( that current ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( In ( ( one ( of ( the joints ) ) ) ( between ( over ( ( 9,000 magnets ) ( in LHC ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( there ( ( was ( a ( manufacturing defect ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( So ( ( ( ( ( the wire ) ( heated ( up slightly ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( its ( 13,000 amps ) ) ( suddenly ( encountered ( electrical resistance ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( This ( ( was ( the result ) ) . ) )
( Now ( that ( ( ( ( 's ( more impressive ) ) ( when ( you ( consider ( those magnets ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( weigh ( over ( 20 tons ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they ( moved ( about ( a foot ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( we ( ( damaged ( about ( 50 ( of ( the magnets ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( We ( ( had ( ( ( to ( ( take them ) out ) ) , ) ( which ( we did ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( ( reconditioned ( them all ) ) , ) ( fixed them ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( ( ( 're all ) ( on ( ( their way ) ( back underground ) ) ) ) now ) . ) )
( ( By ( ( the end ) ( of ( March ( the LHC ) ) ) ) ) ( ( will ( ( be intact ) again ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( We ( will ( ( switch it ) on ) ) ) , ) and ) ( we ( expect ( to ( ( take data ) ( in ( ( June or ) July ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( continue ( with ( our ( quest ( to ( ( find out ) ( what ( ( ( the ( building blocks ) ) ( of ( the universe ) ) ) are ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( I ( ( think ( that ( ( ( ( ( the ( fact ( that ( it ( 's ( so difficult ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( the ( fact ( that ( we ( 're overreaching ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( is ( ( the value ) ( of ( things ( like ( the LHC ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( I ( ( want ( to ( ( start out ) ( by ( ( asking you ) ( to ( ( think back ) ( to ( when ( you ( ( ( were ( a kid ) ) , ) ( playing ( with blocks ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( As ( you ( ( figured out ) ( how ( to ( ( ( reach out ) and ) grasp ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( ( pick them ) up ) and ) ( ( move them ) around ) ) , ) ( you ( ( were actually ) ( learning ( how ( to ( ( think and ) ( ( solve problems ) ( by ( ( understanding and ) ( manipulating ( spatial relationships ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Spatial reasoning ) ( ( is ( deeply ( connected ( to ( how ( we ( ( understand ( ( a lot ) ( of ( the world ) ) ) ) ( around us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( This question ) ( ( was ( ( so compelling ) ( that ( we ( ( ( decided ( to ( explore ( the answer ) ) ) ) , ) ( by ( building Siftables ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In ( a nutshell ) ) ( , ( ( a Siftable ) ( ( is ( ( an ( interactive computer ) ) ( ( the size ) ( of ( a cookie ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( They ( 're ( able ( to ( be ( ( moved around ) ( by hand ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( can ( sense ( each other ) ) ) , ) ) ) ) ( they ( can ( sense ( their motion ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they ( have ( ( ( a screen ) and ) ( a ( wireless radio ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( Most importantly ) ( , ( they ( 're physical ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( ( like ( the blocks ) ) ( , ( you ( can ( ( move them ) ( just ( by ( ( ( reaching out ) and ) grasping ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( Siftables ( ( are ( ( an example ) ( of ( ( ( a ( new ecosystem ) ) ( of tools ) ) ( for ( manipulating ( digital information ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( as ( ( these tools ) ( become ( more physical ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( more ( aware ( of ( their ( motion ( , ( ( aware ( of ( each other ) ) ) ( , ( and ( aware ( of ( ( the nuance ) ( of ( how ( we ( move them ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( can ( start ( to ( explore ( some ( new ( and ( fun ( interaction styles ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( So ( , ( I ( ( 'm ( going ( to ( start ( with ( some ( simple examples ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( This Siftable ) ( is ( configured ( to ( show video ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( if ( I ( ( tilt it ) ( in ( one direction ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( 'll ( ( roll ( the video ) ) ( this way ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( if ( I ( ( tilt it ) ( ( the ( other way ) ) ( it ( ( rolls it ) backwards ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( these ( interactive portraits ) ) ( ( are ( aware ( of ( each other ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( So ( if ( I ( ( put them ) ( next ( to ( each other ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( get interested ) ) ) ) . )
( ( If ( they ( get surrounded ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( notice ( ( ( that too ) , ) ( they ( might ( get ( ( a little ) flustered ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( they ( ( ( can also ) ( sense ( their ( ( motion and ) tilt ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( One ( of ( ( the ( interesting implications ) ) ( on interaction ) ) ) ) ( ( , ( ( we ( started ( to realize ) ) ) , ) ) ( ( was ( that ( we ( could ( ( use ( everyday gestures ) ) ( on ( ( data , ) ( like ( ( pouring ( a color ) ) ( ( the way ) ( we ( might ( pour ( a liquid ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( in ( this case ) ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( ( 've ( got ( ( three Siftables ) ( configured ( to ( be ( paint buckets ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( I ( can ( ( use them ) ( to ( ( pour color ) ( into ( ( ( that ( central one ) ) , ) ( where ( they ( get mixed ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( If ( we overshoot ) ) ( , ( we ( ( can ( ( pour ( a ( little bit ) ) ) back ) ) . ) ) ) )
( There ( ( ( are also ) ( ( some ( neat possibilities ) ) ( for ( ( education , ) ( ( ( ( like ( ( ( ( ( language , ) math ) and ) ( logic games ) ) ( where ( we ( want ( to ( ( give people ) ( the ( ability ( to ( ( try things ) quickly ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( view ( the results ) ) immediately ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( here ( I 'm ) ) ) ( -- ( This ( ( is ( ( a ( Fibonacci sequence ) ) ( that ( I ( 'm ( making ( with ( a ( simple ( equation program ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Here ( we ( ( have ( ( a ( word game ) ) ( that ( 's ( ( kind of ) ( like ( ( a mash-up ) ( between ( ( Scrabble and ) Boggle ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Basically ( , ( ( in ( ( every round ) ( you ( get ( ( a ( ( randomly assigned ) letter ) ) ( on ( each Siftable ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( as ( you ( try ( to ( make ( words ( it ( checks ( against ( a dictionary ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( Then ( , ( ( after ( ( about 30 ) seconds ) ) ( , ( it reshuffles ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( you ( have ( ( ( ( ( a ( new set ) ) ( of letters ) ) and ) ( new possibilities ) ) ( to try ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( ( So ( ( ( ( ( ( ( these ( are ( ( some kids ) ( that ( came ( on ( ( a ( field trip ) ) ( to ( the ( Media Lab ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( I ( managed ( to ( get ( them ( to ( ( try it ) out ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( shoot ( a video ) ) ) ) . )
( They ( really ( ( loved it ) . ) ) )
( And ( , ( ( one ( of ( ( the ( interesting things ) ) ( about ( ( this kind ) ( of application ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( you ( ( do n't ) ( have ( to ( give ( people ( many instructions ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( All ( you ( have ( to say ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( is , ) `` ) ( Make words ) ) , ) '' ) ) and ) ( they ( know ( ( exactly what ) ( to do ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( ( here 's ) ( ( ( another ( few people ) ) ( ( trying it ) out ) ) . ) ) )
( That ( ( 's ( ( ( our ( youngest ( beta tester ) ) ) , ) ( ( down there ) ( on ( the right ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Turns out ) ( , ( ( all ( he ( wanted ( to do ) ) ) ) ( ( was ( to ( ( stack ( the Siftables ) ) up ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( So ( to him ) ) ( , ( they ( ( were ( just blocks ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Now ( , ( this ( ( is ( an ( interactive ( cartoon application ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( we ( ( wanted ( to ( build ( ( a ( learning tool ) ) ( for ( language learners ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( this ( ( is ( ( Felix , ) actually ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( he ( ( ( ( can ( ( bring ( new characters ) ) ( into ( the scene ) ) ) ) , ) ( just ( by ( ( lifting ( the Siftables ) ) ( off ( ( the table ) ( that ( have ( that ( character ( shown ( on them ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Here ( , ( he ( ( 's ( ( bringing ( the sun ) ) out ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( Each ( of these ) ) ( has ( four ( different variations ) ) ) ) , ) ( you ( get ( to ( choose ( which ( one ( you ( want ( to use ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( you ( ( can ( ( ( inject ( these sounds ) ) ( into ( a sequence ) ) ) ( that ( you ( can ( assemble ( into ( ( the pattern ) ( that ( you want ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( you ( ( ( inject it ) ( by ( just ( ( ( bumping up ) ( the ( sound Siftable ) ) ) ( against ( a ( sequence Siftable ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( There ( ( are ( effects ( that ( you ( can ( control ( live ( , ( like ( ( reverb and ) filter ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( You ( ( ( ( ( ( attach it ) ( to ( a ( particular sound ) ) ) ) and ) then ) ( tilt ( to ( adjust it ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( then ( , ( ( ( overall effects ) ( like ( ( ( tempo and ) volume ) ( that ( apply ( to ( the ( entire sequence ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( So ( ( let ( 's ( have ( a look ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( I ( ( ( put ( a ( bass line ) ) ) in ) . ) ) )
( ( So ( ( ( ( I ( ( do n't ) ( have ( to ( ( ( plan it ) out ) ( in advance ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( I ( can ( ( improvise , ) ( making ( it ( longer ( or ( shorter ( as ( I go ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( now ( , ( finally ( , ( I ( ( can ( ( fade ( the ( whole sequence ) ) ) ( out ( using ( ( ( the ( volume Siftable ) ) , ) ( tilted ( to ( the left ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( Thank you ) . )
( So ( , ( ( as ( you ( can see ) ) ) ( , ( ( my passion ) ( ( is ( for ( making ( ( new ( human-computer interfaces ) ) ( that ( are ( ( a ( better match ) ) ( to ( ( the ways ) ( ( our ( ( brains and ) bodies ) ) work ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( And ( today ( , ( I ( had ( time ( to ( ( show you ) ( ( one point ) ( in ( this ( new ( design space ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( a few ) ( of ( the possibilities ) ) ) ( that ( we ( 're ( working ( to ( ( bring out ) ( of ( the laboratory ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( ( ( the thought ) ( I ( want ( to ( ( leave you ) with ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( we ( ( 're ( on ( ( the cusp ) ( of ( ( this ( new generation ) ) ( of tools ) ) ) ) ) ) ( for ( interacting ( with ( ( digital media ) ( that ( are ( going ( to ( ( ( bring information ) ( into ( our world ) ) ) ( on ( our terms ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Thank you ) ( very much ) ) . )
( I ( ( ( look forward ) ( to ( talking ( with ( all ( of you ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( am ( a writer ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( Writing books ) ( is ( my profession ) ) ) but ) ( ( ( it ( 's ( more ( than that ) ) ) ) , ) ( of course ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( ( is also ) ( ( ( my ( great ( lifelong love ) ) ) and ) fascination ) ) . ) )

( And ( ( that search ) ( ( has ( led ( me ( to ( ( ( ancient Greece ) and ) ( ancient Rome ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( They ( ( believed ( ( that ( ( a genius ) ( was this ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( sort of ) ( magical ( divine entity ) ) ) , ) ( who ( was ( believed ( ( ( ( ( to literally ) ( live ( in ( ( the walls ) ( of ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( an ( artist 's ) ) studio ) , ) ( ( kind of ) ( like Dobby ) ) ) ( the ( house elf ) ) ) , ) and ) ( sort ( of invisibly ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( assist ( the artist ) ) ( with ( their work ) ) ) ) and ) ( would ( shape ( ( the outcome ) ( of ( that work ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( ( everyone ( ( ( knew ( that ( this ( is ( how ( it functioned ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) right ) ) ? ) )
( ( So ( ( the ( ancient artist ) ) ( was ( ( ( protected ( from ( certain things ) ) ) , ) ( like ( , ( ( for example ) ( , ( ( ( ( too much ) narcissism ) , ) right ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( ( ( If ( ( your work ) ( was brilliant ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( could n't ) ( ( take ( all ( the credit ) ) ) ( for ( ( it , ) everybody ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( knew ( that ( you ( ( had ( this ( disembodied genius ) ) ) ( who ( had ( helped you ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( Everyone ( ( knew ( ( your genius ) ( was ( kind ( of lame ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( then ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the Renaissance ) ( came ( and ( ( ( ( everything changed ) , ) and ) ( we ( had ( this ( big idea ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( the ( big idea ) ) ( ( was , ) ( let ( 's ( ( put ( the ( individual ( human being ) ) ) ) ( at ( ( the center ) ( of ( ( the universe ) ( above ( all ( ( gods and ) mysteries ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( there ( 's ( ( no ( more room ) ) ( for ( ( mystical creatures ) ( who ( ( take dictation ) ( from ( the divine ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( it ( ( ( ( ( 's ( ( the beginning ) ( of ( rational humanism ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( people ( started ( to ( believe ( that ( creativity ( ( came completely ) ( from ( ( the self ) ( of ( the individual ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( for ( ( the ( first time ) ) ( in history ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( start ( to ( hear ( people ( referring ( to ( ( this or ) ( that ( artist ( as ( being ( ( ( ( a genius ) , ) ( rather than ) ) ( having ( a genius ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( got ( to ( ( ( tell you ) , ) ( I ( think ( that ( was ( a ( huge error ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( You know ) , ) ( I ( think ( that ( allowing ( ( somebody , ) ( ( one ( mere person ) ) ( to ( believe ( that ( ( ( he or ) she ) ( is ( ( like , ) ( ( ( the vessel ) ( , ( ( you know ) , ) ) ) ( like ( ( ( ( ( the font ) and ) ( the essence ) ) and ) ( ( the source ) ( of ( all ( divine ( , ( ( creative ( , ( unknowable ( , ( eternal mystery ) ) ) ) ) ( is ( ( just ( a smidge ) ) ( ( ( too much ) responsibility ) ( to ( put ( on ( one ( fragile ( , ( human psyche ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( It ( ( just completely ) ( ( warps and ) ( ( ( ( distorts egos ) , ) and ) ( it ( creates ( ( all ( these ( unmanageable expectations ) ) ) ( about performance ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( I ( ( think ( ( ( the pressure ) ( of that ) ) ( has ( been ( ( killing off ) ( ( our artists ) ( for ( the ( last ( 500 years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( And ( , ( ( if ( this ( is true ) ) ) ( , ( and ( I ( think ( it ( is true ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the question ) ( ( ( becomes , ) ( what now ) ) ? ) ) ) )
( ( ( Can we ) ( ( do this ) differently ) ) ? )
( Maybe ( ( go ( back ( to ( ( some ( ( more ancient ) understanding ) ) ( about ( ( the relationship ) ( between ( ( humans and ) ( the ( creative mystery ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Maybe not ) . )
( Maybe ( we ( ( ( ca n't ) ( just ( ( erase ( ( 500 years ) ( of ( rational ( humanistic thought ) ) ) ) ) ( in ( one ( 18 ( minute speech ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( And ( she ( ( said ( it ( was ( like ( ( a ( thunderous train ) ) ( of air ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( And ( she ( ( ( ( ( felt it ) coming ) , ) ( because ( it ( would ( ( shake ( the earth ) ) ( under ( her feet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( ( ( ( You know ) , ) ( I ( 've ( ( ( ( ( talked ( about ( some ( of ( these projects ) ) ) ) ) before ) ( -- ( ( about ( ( ( the ( human genome ) ) and ) ( what ( that ( might mean ) ) ) ) ) , ) ) ) and ) ( discovering ( ( new sets ) ( of genes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( , ( we ( ( ( 've always ) ( been ( trying ( to ( ask ( big questions ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( ( ( 've ( tried ( various approaches ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( paring it ) down ) ( to ( minimal components ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( We ( 've ( been ( ( ( digitizing it ) now ) ( for ( ( almost 20 ) years ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( ( when ( we ( sequenced ( the ( human genome ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( was ( ( going ( from ( ( the ( analog world ) ) ( of biology ) ) ) ) ( into ( ( the ( digital world ) ) ( of ( the computer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( This ( is ( ( the map ) ( of ( ( ( ( ( a ( small organism ) ) , ) ( Mycoplasma genitalium ) ) , ) ( that ( has ( ( the ( smallest genome ) ) ( for ( ( a species ) ( that ( can ( self-replicate ( in ( the laboratory ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( we ( 've ( been ( trying ( ( to just ) ( see ( if ( we ( can ( ( come up ) ( with ( an ( ( even smaller ) genome ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( 're ( able ( to ( ( ( knock out ) ( on ( ( the order ) ( of ( 100 genes ) ) ) ) ) ( out ( of ( ( the ( ( 500 or ) so ) ) ( that ( are here ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( When ( we ( look ( at ( its ( metabolic map ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( ( ( 's ( relatively simple ) ) ( compared ( to ( ( ours -- ) ( trust me ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( this ( is simple ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) but ) ( ( when ( we ( look ( at ( ( all ( the genes ) ) ( that ( we ( can ( ( ( knock out ) one ) ( at ( a time ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( 's ( very unlikely ) ) ( that ( this ( would ( yield ( a ( living cell ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( we ( ( decided ( ( the ( only way ) ) ( forward ( was ( ( to actually ) ( ( synthesize ( this chromosome ) ) ( so ( we ( could ( vary ( ( the components ) ( to ( ask ( some ( of ( these ( ( most fundamental ) questions ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Can chemistry ) ( permit ( making ( ( these ( ( really large ) molecules ) ) ( where ( we ( ( 've never ) ( been before ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( And ( ( ( if ( we do ) ) ( , ( ( can we ) ( boot ( up ( a chromosome ) ) ) ) ) ) ? ) )
( ( A chromosome ) ( , ( ( by ( the way ) ) ( , ( ( is ( ( just ( a piece ) ) ( of ( inert ( chemical material ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( So ( , ( ( ( our pace ) ( of ( digitizing life ) ) ) ( ( has ( been ( increasing ( at ( an ( exponential pace ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( Our ( ability ( to ( write ( the ( genetic code ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( has ( been ( moving ( pretty slowly ) ) ) ) but ) ( has ( been increasing ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( ( our ( latest point ) ) ( would ( ( put it ) on ) ) ) , ) ( now ( , ( an ( exponential curve ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( We ( ( started ( this ( over ( ( 15 years ) ago ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( ( ( ( ( took ( several stages ) ) , ) ( in fact ) ) , ) ( starting ( with ( a ( bioethical review ) ) ) ) ) ( before ( we ( did ( the ( first experiments ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( it ( ( ( ( turns out ) ( synthesizing DNA ) ) ( is ( very difficult ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( There ( are ( ( ( tens ( of ( thousands ( of ( machines ( around ( ( the world ) ( that ( make ( ( small pieces ) ( of DNA ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( ( 30 ( to ( 50 letters ) ) ) ( in length ) ) ) ) ) -- ) and ) ( it ( 's ( a ( degenerate process ) ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( ( the longer ) ( you ( make ( the piece ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( the more ) ) ( errors ( there are ) ) ) . )
( So ( we ( ( had ( to ( create ( ( a ( new method ) ) ( for ( ( ( ( putting ( these ( little pieces ) ) ) together ) and ) ( correct ( all ( the errors ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( this ( ( was ( ( ( our ( first attempt ) ) , ) ( starting ( with ( ( the ( digital information ) ) ( of ( ( the genome ) ( of ( phi X174 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a ( small virus ) ) ( that ( kills bacteria ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( ( ( ( designed ( the pieces ) ) , ) ( went ( through ( our ( error correction ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( had ( ( a ( DNA molecule ) ) ( of ( ( about 5,000 ) letters ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( The ( exciting phase ) ) ( came ( when ( we ( ( ( took ( ( this piece ) ( of ( inert chemical ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( put it ) ( in ( the bacteria ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( the bacteria ) ( started ( to ( read ( this ( genetic code ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( made ( the ( viral particles ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( I ( was ( ( talking ( to ( the ( oil industry ) ) ) ) recently ) ) ) and ) ( I ( said ( they ( clearly ( understood ( that model ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( Design ( is critical ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( if ( you ( 're ( starting ( with ( ( digital information ) ( in ( the computer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( that ( ( digital information ) ( has ( to ( be ( really accurate ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( When ( we ( first ( ( sequenced ( this genome ) ) ( in 1995 ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( the standard ) ( of accuracy ) ) ( ( was ( ( one error ) ( per ( 10,000 ( base pairs ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( actually ( ( ( ( ( found , ) ( on ( ( resequencing it ) ( , ( 30 errors ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( ( had we ) ( used ( that ( ( original sequence ) ( , ( it ( never ( would ( have ( been ( able ( to ( be ( booted up ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Part ( of ( the design ) ) ) ( is ( designing ( pieces ( that ( are ( ( ( 50 letters ) long ) ( that ( have ( to ( overlap ( with ( ( all ( the ( other ( 50-letter pieces ) ) ) ) ( to ( build ( smaller subunits ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( we ( ( have ( to ( design ( so ( they ( can ( go together ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( We ( ( ( design ( unique elements ) ) ( into this ) ) . ) )
( You ( ( may ( have ( read ( that ( we ( ( put watermarks ) in ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Triplets ( of ( those letters ) ) ) ( ( ( ( code ( for ( ( roughly 20 ) ( amino acids ) ) ) ) , ) ( such ( that ( there ( 's ( ( a ( single ( letter designation ) ) ) ( for ( each ( of ( the ( amino acids ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( we ( ( can ( ( ( ( use ( the ( genetic code ) ) ) ( to ( ( write out ) words ) ) ) , ) ( ( sentences , ) thoughts ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Initially ( , ( ( all ( we did ) ) ( ( was ( autograph it ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Some people ) ( ( were ( disappointed ( there ( ( was not ) poetry ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( We ( ( designed ( these pieces ) ) ( so ( we ( ( can just ) ( ( chew back ) ( with enzymes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( there ( are ( enzymes ( that ( ( ( repair them ) and ) ( ( put them ) together ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( we ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( started ( making pieces ) ) , ) ( starting ( with ( pieces ( that ( were ( ( ( 5,000 to ) 7,000 ) letters ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( put those ) together ) ( to ( make ( 24,000-letter pieces ) ) ) ) ) , ) then ) ( put ( sets ( of ( those ( going ( up ( to 72,000 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( At ( each stage ) ) ( , ( we ( ( ( ( ( grew up ) ( these pieces ) ) ( in abundance ) ) ( so ( we ( could ( ( sequence them ) ( because ( we ( 're ( trying ( to ( create ( ( a process ) ( that ( ( 's ( extremely robust ) ) ( that ( you ( can ( see ( in ( a minute ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( 're ( trying ( to ( get ( to ( ( the point ) ( of automation ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( , ( this ( ( looks ( like ( a ( basketball playoff ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( knew ( there ( 's ( ( ( a mechanism ) ( called ( homologous recombination ) ) ) ( that ( biology ( uses ( to ( repair ( DNA ( that ( can ( ( put pieces ) together ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( You ( can ( see ( in ( the ( top panel ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( its chromosome ) ( just ( ( gets ( blown apart ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( Twelve to ) 24 ) hours ) later ) ( , ( it ( ( ( ( put it ) ( back together ) ) ( exactly ( as ( it ( was before ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( have ( thousands ( of ( organisms ( that ( can ( do this ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( These organisms ) ( can ( be ( totally desiccated ) ) ) ) ; ) ( they ( can ( live ( in ( a vacuum ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( I ( ( ( am ( absolutely certain ) ) ( ( that ( life ( can ( exist ( in ( outer space ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( move around ) , ) ( find ( a ( new ( aqueous environment ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In fact ) ( , ( NASA ( ( has ( shown ( ( ( a lot ) ( of this ) ) ( is ( out there ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( Here ( 's ( ( an ( actual micrograph ) ) ( of ( ( the molecule ) ( we ( built ( using ( these processes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( actually ( just ( ( ( using ( yeast mechanisms ) ) ( with ( ( the ( right design ) ) ( of ( the pieces ) ) ) ) ) ( we ( ( put them ) in ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( yeast ( ( ( puts them ) together ) automatically ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( This ( ( is not ) ( an ( electron micrograph ) ) ) ) ; ) ( this ( is ( just ( a ( regular photomicrograph ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( 's ( ( such ( a ( large molecule ) ) ) ( we ( can ( ( see it ) ( with ( a ( light microscope ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( These ( ( are ( pictures ( over ( about ( a ( six-second period ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( , ( this ( ( is ( ( the publication ) ( we ( had ( ( ( just a ) short ) ( while ago ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( This ( is ( over ( ( 580,000 letters ) ( of ( genetic code ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( it ( 's ( ( the ( largest molecule ) ) ( ever ( made ( by ( humans ( of ( a ( defined structure ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( 's ( over ( ( 300 million ) ( molecular weight ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( we ( ( ( printed it ) out ) ( at ( ( a ( 10 font ) ) ( with ( no spacing ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( ( takes ( 142 pages ) ) ( just ( to ( print ( this ( genetic code ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Obviously ( , ( ( with ( ( a virus ) ( it ( 's ( pretty simple ) ) ) ) ) ( ; ( it ( ( ( 's ( ( much more ) complicated ) ) ( dealing ( with bacteria ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( With ( ( bacteria and ) Archaea ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( the chromosome ) ( is ( integrated ( into ( the cell ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( we ( recently ( showed ( ( ( that ( we ( can ( ( do ( ( a ( complete transplant ) ) ( of ( a chromosome ) ) ) ) ( ( from ( one cell ) ) ( to another ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( activate it ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( We ( ( ( ( purified ( a chromosome ) ) ( from ( one ( microbial species ) ) ) ) -- ) roughly ) ) ( , ( ( these two ) ( are ( ( as distant ) ( ( as ( human and ) ) mice ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( we ( ( added ( a ( few ( extra genes ) ) ) ) ( so ( we ( could ( select ( for ( this chromosome ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( we ( ( digested it ) ( with ( enzymes ( to ( kill ( all ( the proteins ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( was ( pretty stunning ) ) ( when ( we ( ( put this ) ( in ( the cell ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) and ) ( you ( 'll ( appreciate ( ( our ( ( very sophisticated ) graphics ) ) here ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( The ( new chromosome ) ) ( ( went ( into ( the cell ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In fact ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( we ( thought ( this ( might ( be ( ( as far ) ( as ( it went ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( we ( tried ( to ( ( design ( the process ) ) ( a ( little ( bit further ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( This ( ( is ( ( a ( major mechanism ) ) ( of ( ( evolution right ) here ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( ( find ( ( all kinds ) ( of ( species ( that ( have ( ( ( ( ( taken up ) ( a ( second chromosome ) ) ) or ) ( a ( third one ) ) ) ( from somewhere ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( ( adding ( thousands ( of ( new traits ) ) ) ) ( in ( a second ) ) ) ( to ( that species ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( , ( ( people ( who ( ( think ( of evolution ) ) ( ( ( as ( just ( one gene ) ) ) ( changing ( at ( a time ) ) ) ) ( have ( missed ( much ( of biology ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( There ( ( are ( ( enzymes ( called ( restriction enzymes ) ) ) ( that ( actually ( digest DNA ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( The chromosome ) ( that ( was ( in ( the cell ) ) ) ) ) ( ( does n't ) ( have one ) ) ) ; ) ( ( the chromosome ) ( we ( ( put in ) does ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( It ( got expressed ) ) and ) ( it ( ( recognized ( the ( other chromosome ) ) ) ( as ( foreign material ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( chewed it ) up ) ) , ) and ) so ) ( we ( ( ended ( up just ) ) ( with ( ( a cell ) ( with ( the ( new chromosome ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( It ( ( ( turned blue ) ( because ( of ( ( the genes ) ( we ( put ( in it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( with ( ( a ( ( very short ) period ) ) ( of time ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( all ( the characteristics ) ) ( of ( one species ) ) ) ( were lost ) ) and ) ( it ( converted ( totally ( into ( ( the ( new species ) ) ( based ( on ( ( the ( new software ) ) ( that ( we ( put ( in ( the cell ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( All ( the proteins ) ) changed ) ( , ( ( the membranes ) changed ) ) ) ; ) ( ( when ( we ( read ( the ( genetic code ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( 's ( exactly ( what ( we ( had ( transferred in ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( So ( , ( ( ( ( ( this ( may ( sound ( like ( genomic alchemy ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( we ( ( can , ) ( by ( moving ( ( ( the software ) ( of DNA ) ) ( around ( , ( ( change things ) ( quite dramatically ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( ( ( ( ( ( I ( 've argued ) ) , ) ( this ( ( is not ) genesis ) ) ) ; ) ( this ( is ( building ( on ( ( three and ) ( ( ( a ( half billion ) ) years ) ( of evolution ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( I ( ( 've ( argued ( that ( we ( 're ( about ( ( to perhaps ) ( create ( ( a ( new version ) ) ( of ( ( ( the ( Cambrian explosion ) ) , ) ( where ( there ( 's ( ( massive ( new speciation ) ) ( based ( on ( this ( digital design ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Why ( ( do this ) ? ) )
( I ( ( think ( this ( ( is ( pretty obvious ) ) ( in ( terms ( of ( some ( of ( the needs ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( 're ( about ( to ( ( ( go ( from six ) ) and ) ( ( ( a half ) ( to ( ( nine billion ) people ) ) ) ( over ( the ( next ( 40 years ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( There ( ( are now ) ( ( ( three people ) ( on ( the planet ) ) ) ( for ( ( ( every one ) ( of us ) ) ( that ( existed ( in 1946 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( ( within ( 40 years ) ) ( , ( there ( 'll ( be four ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( It ( ( 's ( going ( to ( be ( ( a stretch ) ( to ( ( do it ) ( for nine ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( ( He ( ( ( ( put ( ( a spray ) ( of saliva ) ) ) ( on ( ( the edge ) ( of ( the ( shit knife ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( as ( it ( finally ( froze solid ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( he ( ( butchered ( a dog ) ) ( with it ) ) ) ) . )

( ( ( The ( official dogma ) ) ( of what ) ) ? )
( ( ( The ( official dogma ) ) ( of ( all ( Western ( industrial societies ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( The reason ) ( for this ) ) ( ( is ( both ( that ( freedom ( is ( ( in and ) ( of ( ( ( itself good ) ( , ( ( ( valuable , ) worthwhile ) , ) ) ) ( essential ( to ( being human ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( ( ( I ( teach ( ( wonderfully intelligent ) students ) ) ) , ) and ) ( I ( assign ( ( ( ( 20 percent ) less ) work ) ( than ( I ( used to ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( it ( ( ( ( ( ( 's not ) ( because ( they ( 're ( less smart ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( 's not ) ( because ( they ( 're ( less diligent ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( All ( of these ) ) ( ( are ( consuming questions ) ) . ) )

( Work ( -- ( ( we ( are ( ( blessed , ) ( as ( Carl ( was ( ( ( pointing out ) , ) ( with ( ( the technology ) ( that ( enables ( us ( to ( ( ( work ( ( every minute ) ( of ( ( every day ) ( from ( ( any place ) ( on ( the planet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( except ( the ( Randolph Hotel ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( I ( ( ( 'm not ) ( ( ( telling you ) ( about it ) ) ( because ( I ( want ( to ( use it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( what ( this means ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( this ( incredible freedom ) ) ( of choice ) ) ( we ( have ( with ( respect ( to work ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( is ( ( that ( we ( have ( to ( ( ( make ( a decision ) ) , ) ( ( ( ( again and ) again ) and ) again ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( about ( whether ( we ( ( should or ) ( ( should n't ) ( be working ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )

( ( All ( of ( this choice ) ) ) ( ( ( ( has ( two effects ) ) , ) ( ( two ( negative effects ) ) ( on people ) ) ) . ) )
( ( One effect ) ( , ( paradoxically ( , ( ( is ( that ( it ( produces ( ( paralysis , ) ( rather ( than liberation ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( With ( ( ( so many ) options ) ( to ( choose from ) ) ) ) ( , ( people ( ( find ( it ( ( very difficult ) ( to ( choose ( at all ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )

( And ( ( what ( she found ) ) ( ( is ( that ( ( for ( ( every ( 10 ( mutual funds ) ) ) ( ( the employer ) offered ) ) ) ( , ( ( rate ( of participation ) ) ( went ( down ( two percent ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Because ( ( with ( 50 funds ) ) ( ( to ( choose from ) ) ( , ( it ( ( ( 's ( so ( damn ( hard ( to ( decide ( ( which fund ) ( to choose ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( that ( you ( ( 'll just ) ( ( ( put it ) off ) ( until tomorrow ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( then ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( tomorrow , ) and ) tomorrow ) , ) and ) tomorrow ) , ) and ) ( of course ) ) tomorrow ) ( never ( comes . ) ) ) ) )
( ( Understand ( that ( ( ( not only ) ( ( does this ) ( mean ( that ( people ( are ( going ( to ( ( have ( to ( eat ( dog food ) ) ) ) ( when ( they ( retire ( because ( they ( ( do n't ) ( have ( ( enough money ) ( put away ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( also ( means ( that ( ( making ( the decision ) ) ( is ( ( so hard ) ( that ( they ( ( ( pass up ) ( significant ( matching money ) ) ) ( from ( the employer ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( By ( not participating ) ) ( , ( they ( ( are ( ( ( ( ( passing up ) ( ( ( as ( much ( as 5,000 ) ) ) dollars ) ( a year ) ) ) ( from ( the employer ) ) ) , ) ( who ( ( would happily ) ( match ( their contribution ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )

( ( ( ( ( The ( more options ) ) ( there are ) ) , ) ( ( the easier ) ( it ( is ( to ( ( ( regret anything ) ( at all ) ) ( that ( ( is disappointing ) ( about ( the ( option ( that ( you chose ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( Well ( , ( ( when ( there ( are ( ( lots ( of alternatives ) ) ( to consider ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( is easy ) ( to ( imagine ( ( the ( attractive features ) ) ( of ( alternatives ( that ( you ( ( reject ( that ( make ( you ( less ( satisfied ( with ( the alternative ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( that ( you ( 've chosen ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( ( Here 's ) ( another example ) ) . )
( Now ( ( this cartoon ) ( ( makes ( ( a lot ) ( of points ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( makes ( points ( about ( living ( ( in ( the moment ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( as well ) , ) and ) probably ) ( about ( ( doing things ) slowly ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( But ( ( ( one point ) ( it ( makes ( is ( that ( ( whenever ( you ( 're ( choosing ( one thing ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( 're ( choosing ( not ( to ( do ( ( other things ) ( that ( may ( have ( lots ( of ( attractive features ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( ( it ( 's ( going ( to ( make ( what ( you ( 're ( doing ( less attractive ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( This ( ( ( hit me ) ( when ( I ( went ( to ( replace ( my jeans ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( I ( ( ( wear jeans ) ( almost ( all ( the time ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( There ( was ( ( a time ) ( when ( jeans ( came ( in ( one flavor ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( you ( bought them ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they ( fit ( like crap ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( ( ( were ( incredibly uncomfortable ) ) , ) ( ( if ( ( ( you ( wore them ) ) and ) ( ( washed them ) ( enough times ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( started ( to ( feel OK ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( Do you ) ( ( want them ) distressed ) ) ? )
( But ( -- ( I ( ( felt worse ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( The reason ) ( I ( felt worse ) ) ) ( is ( that ( , ( ( with ( ( all ( of ( these options ) ) ) available ) ) ( , ( ( ( my expectations ) ( about ( ( how good ) ( ( ( a pair ) ( of jeans ) ) ( should ( be ( went up ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )

( ( ( When ( they ( came ( in ( 100 flavors ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( damn ( ( it , ) ( ( one ( of them ) ) ( should ( 've ( been perfect ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( ( what ( I ( got ( was good ) ) ) ) ( , ( but ( it ( ( was n't ) perfect ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( so ( ( ( ( ( I ( compared ( what ( I ( got ( to ( what ( I expected ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( what ( I got ) ) ( ( was disappointing ) ( in ( comparison ( to ( what ( I expected ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( Adding options ) ( to ( ( people 's ) lives ) ) ) ( ( ( ca n't ) ( ( help but ) ( increase ( ( the expectations ) ( people ( have ( about ( ( how good ) ( ( those options ) ( will be ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( what ( that ( 's ( going ( to produce ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( is ( ( less satisfaction ) ( with results ) ) ) , ) ( ( even when ) ( they ( 're ( good results ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Nobody ( in ( ( the world ) ( of marketing ) ) ) ) ( ( knows this ) . ) )
( ( The truth ) ( ( is ( more ( like this ) ) ) . ) )
( Nowadays ( , ( ( ( ( the world ) ( we ( live in ) ) ) ( -- ( ( we ( ( ( ( ( affluent , ) industrialized ) citizens ) ( , ( ( with ( perfection ( the expectation ) ) ) -- ) ) ) ( ( the best ) ( you ( ( can ever ) ( hope for ) ) ) ) ) ) ( is ( that ( stuff ( is ( ( as good ) ( as ( you ( expect ( it ( to be ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( You ( ( ( will never ) ( ( be ( pleasantly surprised ) ) ( because ( ( ( ( ( your expectations ) , ) ( my expectations ) ) , ) ( have ( gone ( through ( the roof ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( ( ( I ( ( ( want ( to say ) ) -- ) ( ( just ( a ( little ( autobiographical moment ) ) ) ) ( -- ( that ( I ( actually ( am ( married ( to ( a wife ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( she ( ( 's really ) ( quite wonderful ) ) ) ) . )
( But ( settling ( ( ( ( is n't ) always ) ( such ( a ( bad thing ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( What ( ( ( could you ) do ) ? ) )
( ( ( ( When ( there ( are ( hundreds ( of ( ( different styles ) ( of ( jeans available ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( you ( buy ( one ( that ( is disappointing ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( you ( ask ( ( why , ) ( who ( 's responsible ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ? )
( You ( ( could ( have ( done better ) ) ) . ) )
( ( With ( ( ( a ( hundred ( different kinds ) ) ) ( of jeans ) ) ( on display ) ) ) ( , ( there ( ( is ( ( no excuse ) ( for failure ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( And ( ( so ( ( when ( people ( make decisions ) ) ) ( , ( and ( ( even ( though ( ( ( the results ) ( of ( the decisions ) ) ) ( are good ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( feel ( disappointed ( about them ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ; ( ( they ( blame themselves ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( Clinical depression ) ( ( has ( ( exploded ( in ( the ( industrial world ) ) ) ) ( in ( the ( last generation ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( I ( believe ( ( ( ( ( ( ( a ( ( ( ( ( ( significant -- ) ( not ( the only ) ) ) , ) but ) ( a ( significant -- ) ) ) contributor ) ) ( to ( ( this explosion ) ( of depression ) ) ) ) , ) and ) also ) suicide ) , ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( that ( people ( have ( experiences ( that ( ( are disappointing ) ( because ( ( their standards ) ( are ( so high ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( then ( ( when ( they ( have ( to ( ( explain ( these experiences ) ) ( to themselves ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( think ( they ( 're ( at fault ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( so ( ( the ( net result ) ) ( is ( that ( we ( ( ( ( do better ) ( in general ) ) , ) objectively ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( and ( ( we ( feel worse ) ) . ) ) ) ) )

( ( ( ( ( There ( 's ( no ( question ( that ( ( some choice ) ( is ( better ( than none ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( it ( ( does n't ) ( follow ( from ( that ( that ( ( more choice ) ( is ( better ( than ( some choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( I ( ( 'm ( pretty ( confident ( that ( we ( ( have ( long since ) ) ( passed ( ( the point ) ( where ( options ( improve ( our welfare ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( There ( are ( lots ( of ( places ( in ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( we ( have ( heard ( about ( ( ( several ( of them ) ) , ) ( where ( ( their problem ) ( ( is not ) ( that ( they ( have ( ( too much ) choice ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Their problem ) ( ( is ( that ( they ( have ( too little ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( ( the stuff ) ( I ( 'm ( talking about ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( the ( peculiar problem ) ) ( of ( modern ( , ( affluent ( , ( Western societies ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( ( a waste ) ( of money ) ) ) . ) )
( ( What ( I ( 'm ( telling you ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( that ( ( these ( expensive ( , ( complicated choices ) ) ) ) ( -- ( it ( ( ( 's not ) simply ) ( that ( they ( ( do n't ) help ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( actually ( hurt . ) ) )

( ( Income redistribution ) ( ( will ( ( make ( everyone ( better ( off ( -- ( not ( just poor ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( people ( -- ( because ( of ( how ( ( all ( this ( excess choice ) ) ) ( plagues us ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( The more ) ( I ( thought ( about it ) ) ) ) ( , ( however ( , ( ( the more ) ( I ( ( came ( to ( the ( view ( that ( ( this fish ) ( knows something ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( If ( you ( shatter ( this fishbowl ) ) ) ) ( ( so ( that ( everything ( is possible ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( decrease satisfaction ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( You ( increase paralysis ) ) , ) and ) ( you ( decrease satisfaction ) ) ) . )

( ( This one ) ( ( ( ( ( is ( almost certainly ) ) ( too limited ) ) -- ) ( perhaps ( ( even ( for ( the fish ) ) ) ( , ( certainly ( for us ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( But ( ( ( the absence ) ( of ( some ( metaphorical fishbowl ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( is ( ( a recipe ) ( for misery ) ) ) , ) ( and ( , ( I ( ( suspect , ) disaster ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
